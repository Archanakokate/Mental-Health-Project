0,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",doqwow,2364,177,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/
1,"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",16kqyd7,64,377,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/16kqyd7/regular_checkin_post_with_information_about_our/
2,Just taken every pill in my house,"I don't really know what to say and spending your last few minutes on reddit seems sad but  long story short this is the end. I've taken every pill ive got about half an hour ago along with 2 bottles of wine and 8 beers. I wasn't cut out for this world, I can't remember ever feeling happiness and I've asked my family to be honest and no one can genuinely name a time where ive been happy. Eating disorders, autism, anxiety, depression, adhd, ocd. You name It and its me.

The funny thing is I have no regrets and I can't wait for my long sleep. I wake up every single day wishing I never do, pop more sleeping pills then trying to sleep even more. Rinse and repeat 

Ive been through all types of therapy since about 10 years old and been on every anti depressant under the sun. The only thjbgg that works are benzos and opiates but the doctor cut me off benzos and no one will ever give opiates for even the worst depression 

So this is my time. I wish you all well but this is my time now ",1b4friy,204,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b4friy/just_taken_every_pill_in_my_house/

I have no girlfriend no friends nobody to talk to. my family doesn't give a shit what's going on in my life. I have no one in my life.

5,I’m a fucking worthless loser,"I’m 25. I’ve spent the last 4 years studying dentistry, trying to get accepted into medicine and working my ass off for it. I’m now at my last year of my bachelor’s degree (premed) and I don’t want to stay here at all and I fucking hate it.
I hate myself for spending so much valuable years and time on getting somewhere I didn’t want to be just to impress others. I want to have a better more experience full life but I can’t fucking get myself to start a new chapter (thinking of going back to dental school).

7,I regret how much of my life I've wasted on depression.,"I'm on medication for the past five months or so and it has helped a bit. I had a severe anxiety and depression breakdown last year and, despite not wanting to take medication, I went to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with depressive disorder and anxiety disorder.

Anyway I turn 29 in a couple weeks and I've been reflecting a bit on just how much depression has messed with me. My teenage years were a nightmare. I don't like looking back on that at all. I'm somehow made it through college and, for what it's worth, I have a great job and my own studio apartment in the city. But then I think about how I only have one or two friends and my parents are constantly on me about relationships. I am almost 29 and have never been in a long-term, committed relationship. This doesn't bother me most of the time, I don't mind being single, until my parents badger me about it or I see people I knew in high school getting married and having kids and buying a house.

I see so many people my age going out constantly and having large, close friend groups and I've just...never had that. For the most part, I just kind of hang around at home a lot and my hobbies are fairly solitary. Until recently, I never really wanted to make an effort to be social. Even now though, I feel like because I isolated myself so much due to depression, I feel so socially behind other people my age. I could have been out doing stuff and I did nothing.

I know 29 is still young and I have a lot of life left, but...still. I think it is easy to just get stuck in the past.",1b4eszk,17,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b4eszk/i_regret_how_much_of_my_life_ive_wasted_on/
8,The thought of committing suicide is becoming easier to accept..,"I’ve had social anxiety since I was a teenager. I’m now 28(male) and I’m still struggling mentally with anxiety but much worse. It has gotten to the point that I was approved for SSI because anxiety interferes with my ability to communicate and develop “real” relationships with people.
   For the past few years suicide has entered my mind countless times. A year back, after years of countless attempts at trying to find mental help, I gave Albany Medical Center in NY a try. denied me help because “they don’t have the ability to help me” the supervisor denied me after a referral from my primary and never referred me to anywhere else. This is when I had enough of the witch-hunt and hung myself. I woke up on a concrete floor face down in an unbelievable amount of blood with a power cord around my throat. I didn’t realize at first but my chin was cracked wide open to the bone and had fallen from a heavy bag stand. 
  Now fast forward to today and I’m getting that “just do it” thought. The thought of death used to scare me but now it’s like way out. If you haven’t figured it out, I’m going to make sure of it this time. Problem is I dread my family finding me, especially my mom. I also don’t want to just ghost and never be found again as that is likely worse than knowing. What would you do in my situation?

9,my cousin (28f) just died,"i am really struggling right now. she has always been there as part of my life and suddenly a bunch of pills and alcohol later, she isn’t there anymore. what the hell. i am in shock and i don’t know what to do. please, i just need someone to hear me. i am in pain. i was hoping she would make it when she needed a new liver, so i messaged her on insta to hang out once she gets better, then i learned that her brain died. she isn’t getting better. she is dead. i will never get to talk to her again. she will never tell me her crazy stories again. we will never bond again. i am in pure shock and disgust at the world. she was such an amazing person with amazing potential, and it is all gone.

10,Depression.,"I’ve been depressed since I’ve been 15 years old. Im

11,I’ve decided I won’t kill myself until I learn how to master driving my manual car.,"I recently bought my first manual car. It’s a 2019 WRX and I’m a huge rally racing nerd but I’ve never driven manual before. 

It’s been a month since I bought it and am finally over the fear being anxious driving anywhere. I’ve struggled with depression and have taken great strides from where I was in the past. I have a proper job now. I’m learning how to be strong by myself and live by myself. I’m working hard on just being a better person than I was yesterday but deep down I’m so tired. I’ve been tired for years. 

The new job requires a lot of me and I’ll just say I sell high end cars. I’m reaching the point where I don’t have much left in me to continue taking care of myself and being proactive. Day by day I feel more tired and more exhausted. Just drained. I’m losing enjoyment in things that brought me joy before because I have no energy for them. Every now and then I think about killing myself. Some days more than others. I’ve only once ever had a plan but that was a couple years ago and never had a day picked out. If anything I feel like I would kill myself spontaneously. 

I’m still exhausted and alone. I’m 23 years old and don’t have many friends outside of work except from my home state which means they are 1+ hour away and with my work schedule now, I never see them. I come home from work and sit in my room alone. I live with my parents and realized when I was younger how much of a stress I put on my parents because of my bad mental health. Now I don’t tell them much about how I’m feeling but try to stay stoic. 

My exhaustion has gotten so bad that the thoughts of ending it are increasing. The one thing I promised myself was that I won’t end it until I master my car. I don’t know exactly why I made that promise to myself. I guess it’s because if I do it before I pay off the car my parents will take on that debt and lose their son. Mastering manual cars is something that takes time. So it’s a long road ahead. Another thing I thought of was that the journey that this will provide me may actually bring some hope in my life. And I get a small little bit of joy that the dream of my car saving my life will be there. But in the end it’s just a fantasy. That my car will save me from misery. 

In a sense it may be an ultimatum, every time I get the thought of just committing myself to death I remember this promise. And that the promise doesn’t have a concrete goal because what exactly is “mastering a manual car”? 

It could be an infinite means with no end goal. And I wonder if what I promised is exactly positive or morbid? I don’t know why I came to Reddit to express this but I think it’s just because I have no outlet and hold thoughts in.

 Can anyone help me understand if a promise like this is a step in the right direction or just a morbid insight? 

How do I help myself from constant exhaustion? I want to be positive and proactive but can’t find the energy and feel as though I’m at the end. And the only thing keeping me going is learning how to drive a car but in turn creating a shell of a human being.

12,Is salvation only achieved by starting a family?,"I'm a guy. I would love to have children. I even picked their names already, but i can't with a clear conscience bring someone into this world. It feels immoral. I love my children too much to bring them into this mess.

I realized this a couple of years ago when i was experiencing the happiest moment of my life. I still would chose not existing over that. Do not get me wrong. I would not kill myself, but life itself is not ""needed"".... It feels like a big pyramid scheme where people keep ""inviting"" others to join just to avoid being lonely.

For brief moments i felt hatred towards my parents for bringing me here, but i realize they are just people trying to navigate this life of the first time, so i chose to love them instead and recognize how good they are (My mother is an angel).

Maybe that's not a lot for you. But for me, that was about a year and a half worth of savings. Poof. Gone just like that.

And I just don't want to exist anymore. And maybe you might think dying over money is stupid. But money is literally everything in this world. You can't do shit without money. You can't do the things you want to do without money. And every single time I try to do something to better my situation. I get absolutely fucked.

22,My depression severely affected my academic career and now I'm trying to apply for a second application cycle for vet school.,"I started college in spring 2020 as a 4.0 presidents honor role student and stayed that way for the first two semesters - so spring 2020 and fall 2020. Then my mental health took a severe downward turn and I am still struggling to pull it back into place. I want to go to veterinary school, but I have c's in all of my chemistry, organic chemistry and biochemistry courses. Some b's in my math and physics and A's in the rest including biology. I applied to vet school this past cycle and got turned down from all of my choices. I can't redo my classes since they are undergraduate and I will be graduating with my bachelors this may and need that time to make my application shine in other respects like hours with a vet shadowing. And to be honest I would have turned me down that first cycle to - my application absolutely sucked. I had below average essays and gpa (right now I have a 3.3 overall and 3.0 science - this should be better after this semester as I have kept A's in all of my courses so far), no current experience, and virtually no clinical experience.

It is just so hard to think of what I could have should have done to make my current position better. I am angry with myself that I didn't do better in my core classes. I'm angry that I didn't think to get help earlier. I'm angry that I didn't pull myself up and get some vet experience. I'm so angry with myself and how my sadness has the potential to ruin my chances of getting into medical school. How do I explain to teachers and professors and vets that I didn't get the experience I needed because it took all of my energy to just  get out of bed let alone come to class. How do you explain that to people who tell you that you are below average in basically everything that you need to get into vet school and that I should have tried harder? Studied harder? gotten help? talked to professors? How the fuck do you explain that I was just trying to stay alive and on this earth for another day and got to the point were I truly didn't care what happened to me anymore?

But yet I'm am still here, I came out the other side of my sister running away, my grandmas hording house being gone through by my mother and myself for 4 months and then sold with her being put into a home, I came out the other side with my other grandma and grandpa passing within days of each other. I came out the other side when my parents fought like cats and dogs. I came out the other side. And I'm proud that I did, but why in the hell did all of this have to leave such a mark. A mark that has the potential to change the entire coarse of my life.

I still struggle daily with dark thoughts, depression and anxiety. I'm trying to turn my life around and make the best of what has happened and take control of my life again. I have vet shadowing set up with two local veterinarians, I'm volunteering at my local humane society, and my mentor and I are talking about the possibility of me either double majoring with a minor or just moving on with a masters while I'm in this in-between stage for vet school (basically trying to make my academic resume look better for my second application cycle), my parents and I communicate better and I am on some meds.

But truly... how do you explain without making it sound you want pity - that my academic career got severely affected by poor mental health?",1b4iu6g,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b4iu6g/my_depression_severely_affected_my_academic/
23,🤍,"I’m exhausted. Life has been tough lately. I’m craving real connections. Yet when I look around all I find is mobile eating zombies with no real sense of real connection. And I’m tired. I too I’m one of those zombies. Which is ironic. I miss when I was younger, Life wasn’t this complicated like it is now. We all trying struggling and having constant cravings of success and thinking once I reach a certain level, I’ll become happy and this continues race will end some how but it ends with death at the end I guess. I, sometimes think I would like to toughen up and scream so they leave me in the asylum where I can just exist in peace. Asylum. Won’t be bad, no care for what people think and no care for where I should be and go next? I’m tired and yet not in the end. I want real connection but all I want now is a quiet place far from this noisy city. Continuous moving is terrifying to me. Sometimes I like to be just numb and I wish I was mute. I scold myself every time i speak. I don’t know what fun people get talking about random shits. I would like to vanish into thin air. Maybe everyone will try to find me but with years they won’t care. I’m sure they will move on with or without me. They will all live as I never existed and as I’ve never been in their lives.

24,I think my city is making me depressed. Should I leave it all behind?,"I know they say ""wherever you go, there you are,"" but I wonder if that's always true. 

I'm a mid-30s woman, and I've lived in the same city my entire life. For context, it's considered one of the best cities to live in worldwide. I've got a good job, great apartment, close friends, family nearby, and a borderline debilitating urge to leave it all behind and just move to another country. I feel absolutely depressed here, but I'm scared of making the wrong decision. 

The thing is, despite how great this city is, I feel like I have too much trauma tied to it. As good as my life seems seems on paper, I've been through a lot here, including: growing up with an alcoholic parent, having a close friend die suddenly (roommates at the time), enduring an emotionally traumatizing relationship (5+yrs), and being assaulted (S.A.). I have a lot of trauma from men throughout my entire life, unfortunately.

I have been in therapy for a decade, was doing ok, but then my sweet angel dog passed away. He was basically holding me together all these years—my absolute best friend. It's been over a year and I sob almost every day after I come home. My therapist says that as long as I'm functioning (eating, going to work, doing life tasks) then it's okay; I'm just grieving. But I am practically crawling out of my skin to get out of here and leave everything behind. The only time I am happy is when I'm out of the country (I travel for a month each summer) and then I come back and am beyond depressed again. 

If I leave, I'll probably never be able to come back realistically. My job and apartment are rare gems in this city, so it's a massive risk. But I can't keep going like this; something's gotta change. ",1b4fnhd,5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b4fnhd/i_think_my_city_is_making_me_depressed_should_i/

I'm supposed to be in this really good position, I have a house, investment propeties, I'm a millionaire in my late 20s, I have a grad school degree with a high GPA in a STEM field. I can go anywhere, do whatever I want etc etc.

But I feel like there is nothing to do, nowhere to go, nothing worth buying, not interested in traveling or seeing anything, to me, it is the same shit with the same coat of paint.

I have had two childhood cancers, I've been short and bald since nine years old. I go outside and it's like walking around on Mars, I don't have much in common with anyone. 

No one wants to talk to me and I feel like an alien. I've been single since birth because why would anyone want to interact with a bald, short white guy?  


I sit at home all day because I don't see the value in trying to do anything. I've spent almost 12 years working on my career and school, that even at the point where I have massive diminishing returns, I still just keep studying for some hypothetical position that I don't even need.

46,I found a knife under my wife's pillow yesterday,"Hi, this will be a long text.

Context:My wife suffers from depression for about 2 years now. Or at least that's when she has been diagnosed, started getting meds and since then she is in therapy. We both think she has been depressed for some time before that.

During this period there were ups and downs, but last \~6 months were super hard for me. I try to be as supportive as it gets, but I started feeling like a punching bag. My wife is functional - she actually runs her own small company and still maintains her social life to some extent. All energy she has left in her she spends on keeping up the facade of a normal life. Unfortunately, I feel like I am in the other side of the spectrum - our relationship is going to shits. Usually after spending all the energy on professional and social life she comes home and either falls asleep for 12-14 hours or becomes super irritable. Lately she says she has been doing better, but I don't see the reflection of it in our life - actually the opposite. Lately we started going to the therapy together (per my request), but it didn't bring no positive results (we are high and positive after the therapy, but then eveything goes back to normal almost immediately)

When she was diagnosed I decided to go to therapy myself to both make sure I give her appropriate support, but at the same time to have a place for focusing on my own emotions with regard to her depression. While for first 1,5 years I could manage daily life with her depression, for the past 6 months I have been gradually feeling worse myself. I can't focus at work (and I am our main source of income, so I can't loose focus), I started getting physical symptoms (bruxism) and most of all, I started having suicidal thoughts myslef. At first I was shrugging them off, but this week it was too much and I took them to my therapist. While before that she was advising to take time and digest emotions when I was upset with our relationship, this time she said I have to take some action - whether that be a breakup, separation or some other radical change in our lives. During the course of multiple weeks of therapy we confirmed our relationship was the source of my current state.

Now I tie it back to the title.

Yesterday I decided to let her know how I feel. I told her that I am feeling really really bad (without disclosing my suicidal thoughts though) and I really really need a change in our life. Let her know that I am serious. As always we had a discussion, exchanged how we feel, she said she feels similarily and after some time she says she does not have energy to talk no longer. She took a bath and went to our bedroom.

After around 30 mins, she messages me saying ""can you give me a hug?"". I heard her crying quitely for the past 30 mins (I normally would go and try to comfort her, but she asked some time ago not to do it unless she asks for it), so I go and give her a hug. We proceed to talk for another half an hour, after which I feel something hard under the pillow and realize it's a handle of our kitchen knife.

Obviously I am distressed at this point, I knew she sometime has suicidal thoughts but it was never this real. I keep my composure and proceed to spend next 2 hours talking with her about it until she actually feels good, is happy we had this conversation and we actually manage to turn the whole situation into something constructive and helpful for her. We fall asleep together. During the conversation she says she sometimes takes the knife to feel better but would never do anything to herself and I should not be worried. She says she has been doing this for a long time already. It turns out she never mentioned it to her therapist, so I convince her she needs to do it for things to get better.  


Today she seemed to be happy, she was energetic and everything goes well, she goes to work, I go to work, it seems we pulled her out from this depressive state. All is well again.  


But I am not - I know that we fought off yesterday's evening crisis but not the long-term crisis. In a day or two again everything will fall apart.  


I need support in two things:

\- Knife in bed - what do I do now? She is in therapy, she takes meds, she visits psychiatrist, I do not know what else could be done now? 

\-Myself - I feel I am trapped. Any mention of my mental wellbeing leads to an argument, and arguments lead to her falling back into depression. Now on top of that I constantly will think about the fact she might have a knife with her anytime my boundaries are being crossed. I am her main support, we have been together since high school, for the past 10 years we grew up together. She does not have anyone who she could really lean back on.  
On the other hand I do not know how much do I still have in me to be there for her while I myself am falling deeper and deeper into a hole

It seems like a lot of people don’t believe in mental health and attribute our struggles to character defects. Because of this behavior, it makes it difficult to open up to others as judgment during a depressive state creates wounds, given that I am more sensitive in that state.

53,La dejé ir.,"La vida a veces no es como queremos, el amor a veces no es bonito, a veces es necesario soltar todo y no quedarse con las ganas o el nudo de decir todo lo que uno quiere soltar.

Hoy tomé la decisión de decirle todo a ella, todo lo que siento, pero como una niña inmadura no se lo tomó bien y claro no le importó, ella decía que somos amigos pero realmente no se siente como una amistad, su falta de interés es grande, su falta de madurez también y en verdad es feo porque realmente esperé a que cambiara o algo.

Agradezco todo sinceramente lo que pasé con vos, pero no puedo soportarlo mas, no puedo darme ese permitido de amarte sabiendo que es imposible porque no me dejas hacerlo. Lloro y te recuerdo, recuerdo todas las cosas hermosas que vivimos, los viajes, salidas, besos, caricias, dormir juntos, los eventos a los que fuimos, recuerdo todo eso, y en verdad fue bonito, a pesar que peleábamos mucho y terminábamos constantemente, quiero decir que pese a todo fuiste la mejor amiga que pude tener y el gran amor de mi vida, hoy lamentablemente tengo que dejarte ir, te amo pero no eres para mí, y sinceramente quiero quedarme pero mi corazón y cerebro están cansados, están hartos de ti, hartos de como me tratas, cada palabra desinteresada que me escribís, cada día que no te importa nada de como me siento, saber que si no te hablo vos no me hablas, saber que pese a todo la vida nos quiso juntos pero no fuimos capaces de estar juntos.

No me gusta la idea de que te vayas, terminar todo y hasta siempre, no quiero, lo detesto, siempre dije que no me iré nunca de tu lado pero me terminé yendo, y tengo que hacerlo porque sino no puedo progresar con mi vida.

Te amo, pero hasta aquí lo dejo, me dejaste muchas cosas lindas pero ya no puedo soportarlo. hasta siempre mi gran y posible amor de mi vida, espero que algún día podamos volver a hablar o no sé, te extrañaré, y cuídate.",1b4h0sh,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b4h0sh/la_dejé_ir/

62,Depression sometimes feels like home.,"Weird tittle not even sure if this is the right place but 🤷‍♂️ fuck it. Need some advice from peers. 

I’m 17 and have an amazing gf that I’ve been with around 7 months, we started out talking ish last January where I was a narcissistic-horny- nude obsessed- womanizer, complete just dick for Brains and I treated her like shit. After about a month after that I deleted snap where I was being an ass to every woman on my friends list which is the worst part of my life so far and biggest regret I worked on becoming better and even took my grandma finding out and telling me I was awful to realize and want to change. After about 6 months I became better and we got together for real this time over my summer job, so I’ve r the last 7 months we haven’t had really any problems. 

Now about the depression. Before her before January talking to her and being a fucking ass. I was with this girl who I guess you could say was my “first true love” or whatever cause I guess she was the first girl to give me attention (July: 2022) we “dated” for like 4 months until like November where she sorta but not really cheated and then insulted me in-front of all my friends where we got into a very heated argument in front of her parents and arguments for me just turn into me wanting to punch the closest thing cause anger issues are really bad and I have 0 self control, irrelevant. 

She embarrassed me and destroyed every part of me that could love and trust someone and I just fell into this really depressed state of mind where I isolated myself and blasted Lewis Capaldi and NF all day and hid every bit of emotion I had. But now that I’m happy again it’s not that I want to be depressed but I felt safer, I felt more content and in control and like idk just felt more like home. If that makes any sense. Instead of music I listened to while depressed being a bad memory it’s more of a nostalgic taste and feeling.

I found someone, he stayed. But he was abusive, in every way. He destroyed me more than I could ever destroy myself. I stayed with him for three years, hoping he would change- and love me in the way I deserve to be loved. I left him a month ago, life seems to be better now, but I am so fucking lonely. 
The darkness and pain has never left. Doctors, therapists, antidepressants, drugs, alcohol - nothing frees me from this burning need to no longer be.

71,"I'm a victim of ""stealthing""","I M(30), was hooking up with a W(31), that I've grown close with over these past few months. We had just gotten back from getting condoms, and I was on bottom, I was pretty high at the time and kind of just froze in confusion as to what was happening, and if I was interpreting everything correctly, or just missing some key information. It's a relatively long distance relationship, and she was just in town for a long a weekend. I don't recall if I voiced how I was feeling that weekend, but I don't think I did, since I wanted to just try and brush it off and enjoy the little time we had together.  
  
I previously mentioned how we had gotten close, with that comes being vulnerable and sharing things, things that you might have only shared with a handful of people. One of the things I had shared with this woman was that I was raped when I was just a 10 year old boy. This is something I had deeply suppressed, but that memory came crashing back into my life when I was 20, and I strongly believe a lot of it was because of just deep introspection, and the height of the ""me too"" movement.  
  
This ""stealthing"" incident happened back in January, but I've only really been coming to the realization of it all over the past week. At first I was just gaslighting myself and trying to downplay it, but I'm not going to lie, I feel so betrayed. Trust is an extremely important thing to me, and I truly don't think she is a bad person, but this one act has just made me reevaluate this entire relationship. I just don't understand how someone who knows my past, could make a call like that on their own, without my consent, especially considering she isn't on birth control.

72,I feel impatient and stressed,"Heya, just mostly a vent but also wishing to get a bit of advice potentially.

So I’ve been dealing with a relapse of depression for more than a month by now, trying to get a bit of help from my parents as what I believe to be part of the problem is both that my friends aren’t really good to rely on as close friends, and the fact that I legit have no clue how to make new friends now that I’m an adult.

My mom has tried her best to try to help me, even reaching out to a childhood friend of mine as we are planning on going outside together to catch up, sadly due to her being busy she wasn’t able to come this weekend, but said that she’ll see if she can do it on the next one.

Probably for me though mostly is that I already feel like I’ve reached a limit as to where I’m having more frequent episodes of anxiety and self doubt, wondering if I even deserve friends, it has definitely not helped either that I’ve felt much more down due to winter, since I don’t have much to really even do outside, so instead I’m left with my free time being spent inside, milking out the little happiness I can get from my games and hobbies.

TLDR: depression relapsed a while ago, and every attempt at trying to find ways to get better are taking a long time, but I feel like I’m at my limit",1b4el15,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b4el15/i_feel_impatient_and_stressed/

Then awful things begin to happen in my mind, I start self-discouraging and in 9 out of 10 times I end up feeling lonely, depressed, and exhausted. Plus, even if I try to do something, I can’t continue it because I keep having negative thoughts and lack of motivation.

I only really have my mum and cat to live for, if anything happens to either of them, I know the rest of my family will be fine, if not better off without a burden like me around.   


I’ve already written several notes for if/when I go through with it, I just feel so empty and lonely everyday, ever since I attempted, I have no urge to pursue a future, I’m just stuck working a shit job, which makes me wanna commit even more.

I’ve always been overweight, I’m used to it, I’ve lost weight before, but it’s never made me feel any better, I still feel miserable.



I dated someone a few years ago for 2 years and it ended with them harassing me for months (before moving away) and her friends harassing me till this day, they come to my place of work and smirk, my ex spread lies before moving away, no idea what, but their looks give it away. It makes me realise that I’ll never be able to fully trust anyone, I’ve talked to people since but always get ghosted, I give up trying to approach women, when I know it’s gonna be a guaranteed no, and even if they did say yes, I wouldn’t want someone I care about dating some creepy fat depressing weirdo like me, all I’d do is bring them down, make them as empty as I am. 



I’ve tried to get help, but other than paying a decent amount of money (that I don’t have) to some professional, I’ve only got 2 options talking over the phone to someone, I’ve done that and it didn’t help, or taking a concoction of pills that drs think would help, for a months worth of time to see the effects it would have on me, I’m already weird as shit, don’t need pills doing more damage.

I hadn’t realized something was wrong with but when I turned 12 the urges of hurting myself just went away. It came back 2 years later and I started to cut my wrist and I wasn’t sure why, I just felt empty. I wanted to know what the fuck happened to me and why and that’s when I came to realize that so many things were fucked up in my life. When I was 8 I once saw my father choke my mother and then my mother was taken away from me because she did drugs and I couldn’t see her for 2 months, during that time I felt stressed and alone. When she came back she became better but because she was taken away from me due to drugs I had a fear she would be taken away from me when she just got drunk on alcohol so now every time me she gets drunk or has a bit of alcohol I feel paranoid. When I turned 14 and depression hit me it was just emptiness and I engaged in self harm but during that time I had a fear that after self harm I would want to commit suicide. My fear came true but it wasn’t much of a fear. I am now older and I want to commit suicide but I know I won’t engage in it or at least I hope.

I don't remember well why I did it, all I know is that at one point I felt as if my struggles aren't valid if I don't hurt myself.

One night I've cut under my wrist and forgot about it the next day, when my parents saw it... It was the worst experience of my life. They yelled at me, made fun of me and my suicidality, even insulted me, told me how I have no reasons to be unhappy etc etc. They even took my stuff away for that whole day...

Who needs hell I am already living in it.
Why can't I be special or good like others, why do I always have to suck at everything, even after efforts I can't be as good as other normal people, I just always get anxiety that I am not doing enough, like my art sucks, I drew for hours and still nothing, in practical lab my practicals were always sub par, I thought trying to put more effort doing them 20-30 more times than others will make me catch up, but it just didn't, like before exams I pieces my finger 50 times to get perfect slide but it was not enough and I still messed up. 
I can't even talk to people properly bo matter how much I try to be charismatic and talk properly, I can't even compete with people in competitive exams, I am stuck in an ugly body, and in the wrong gender, even if i transition I won't pass, why can't I have something good, atleast one good thing, it seems like all the efforts are pointless, and I can never be good enough, i am single since birth and i already have accepted I can never be open enough, fun enough or good enough for someone, or offer them something better, I am just the person who tries and never win and I am tired of it, idk why am I even trying anymore, even after weight loss my body still looks gross, worse I even started balding at 22, just let me have a positive curve in my growth please !!?

83,My father is the greatest pain in my life,"I hate my father. He has made my life miserable. Living with him is very difficult. Hes very manipulative, hes a narcissist and pays attention and scolds me for every single thing I do. He has no job nor does he want to get a job and lets my angel of a mother do all the work. Im a kid but I wish I could work just to help my mother. Let me give you guys an example of what happens almost everyday. This morning I woke up and the minute I woke up he says in our language ""Why do you look so tired? Change your attitude."", and then I go to pee ""Why do you walk like that?? Wear your slippers, you're so old and you still don't wear slippers!"", and then after peeing I got to get rice because he yelled at me to go eat ""Why do you get rice that way?? Who taught you to get rice like that??"" Btw I just scooped it normally... He was expecting me to do this weird thing and like carve it from the surface, but anyways... So yeah he minds every single thing I do. He can never mind his own business. I don't have a room. I sleep in the living room and hes making it actual hell for me as I am afraid of him. I suffer from severe anxiety issues because of him. I can't complain to my mother about him anymore as she defends him and says to me ""hes trying his best to change"". He doesn't even work and lets you do all the work... My mother can't see she is being manipulated. I will keep this all to myself now as I don't want to stress my mother more by complaining about him. My father is also very moody. He'll say all this stuff and pay attention to everything I do, get angry, and then switch up completely into showing some affection when I look so tired from faking a smile and keeping myself from being annoyed at him. He is manipulative and I hate seeing it especially on my younger siblings as they are stressed living with him as well. My life would be so much more peaceful without him. This may sound bad but I really do want him gone as I gave him all my chances in the past but he is still the same person. I am afraid of him and confronting him and theres no use talking to him because you can't reason with stupid.

84,SAHD I'm convinced depression is real,"(26M) So I'm pretty sure I have depression. I've for the longest time always thought it was a hoax and how could anyone feel that way? Just slap yourself out of it. But I think I have slowly been falling into it for the past few months and now I'm in it. Before the beginning of last year I was happy. I lived in the city, i had a nice job, a loving wife, happy kids. But I had a buisness opportunity come up and we packed up and moved back where I'm from which is a rural area. I ended up getting screwed out of the property I was suppose to be renting. Ended up not being able to find another location so we decided I would be the stay at home parent and my wife would go back to work. We than also decided it would be good for her to continue school. So she is a full time employee and full time student. I have been watching my kids (5Y M) (2Y G) (7.5MTH G) for the past year. In the beginning it was great but as time went on I started losing myself as a person. My wife and I both noticed I started lashing out at small things. I went from someone who's worked since I can remember to someone who stays home all day on the couch listening to baby talk all day. My parents AND my wifes parents decided to get divorced last year. My friends don't talk to me anymore, I don't ever leave the house, I'm fine with my wife providing but I want to contribute as well. The jobs in this area don't pay anywhere near enough for me to go back to work and to get a baby sitter. I'm unsure how to handle this depression stuff. Also I'm not suicidal but I don't see the point in living if that makes any sense(it feels like my own brain or thoughts tell me sometimes whats the point in living a life like this when i dont want to think like that). I want to be here for my kids and wife but I also feel empty as a person and a man. I'm awkward in social settings when I use to be great at talking to people. My wife tries to help where she can but she quite honestly isn't the type of person who could help someone through depression. My mom told me to either get help or get over it. It's not that I don't want to make changes it just our situation and financially where we are this is just how it has to be for now.  I guess I posting to both find people who can relate, get some things off my chest and maybe find some ways to navigate this beast.",1b4hkfo,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b4hkfo/sahd_im_convinced_depression_is_real/
85,Life sucks.. rant,"I hate that I have to participate in life when I don’t want to be here. I could leave this life that’s true but I tried to OD 3 times and it failed each time. It’s not only embarrassing but also so frustrating to still be here. Next time it has to be certain otherwise I can’t go thru with it. I’m only 19 but I’ve been depressed even as a kid, it never goes away because I was always depressed, there’s no happiness or normal to return to. My baseline is fkin depression. It’s rare to see me feeling happy and when i do it’s bc i am so distracted from reality. I’ve had small moments of happiness whether be from a romance I thought would fulfill me and give me motivation to stay or thru drugs/alcohol for the temporary high. 

Ppl see love as cheesy but it’s all I ever wanted and it’s something that could actually convince me to stay here. It’s like the one silver lining to me about life but ppl are so fake and they break ur heart and leave u. Then you’re alone again and back at square one. Even in a relationship I’m still suffering with the emptiness and lack of motivation but at least I have someone to feel that emptiness with so it lessens a bit and i get to feel something better. 

I am useless in the eyes of society bc I don’t have a job but I cannot sustain one. When the suicidal thoughts come rampant i cannot get myself to do anything so how tf am i supposed to upkeep a job. I’ve ruined almost all my friendships bc of my emotional states. Ppl have their own shit to worry about too I have no one to talk to about this more than a “I relate”. These thoughts consume me every day and I really just want to cease to exist. And I also am dealing with some health struggles and it is all just too much. I need relief from my suffering.

we are forced to be here even when we are suffering so we really have to suffer if we want to leave. and even then it’s not guaranteed to work and attempting could make ur life here on earth even more miserable.. I need a reliable way out. But I also need a lot of guts to do it and not think twice beforehand. Maybe alcohol would do the trick.

89,Floating on the Surface ,"Recently I have been struggling to feel much at all. It's not the same as when I was younger and would have a severe depressive episode; I don't feel like killing myself or staying locked in my room for months on end. I just feel lost. As if I have no drive, motivation or aspirations. As if I'm floating above everything, not apart of anything and no will to be.
I'm a law student so I have exams to prepare for but I just don't care. I know I'll do alright as I always have, but it just doesn't bother me tbh. I have an incredible girlfriend whom I love very much, but even then I don't feel too fussed about seeing her these days. 
I've lost all interest in TV or video games or reading. I used to pass most of my time with at least one of these, but now I just lie on mu bed and wait for sone motivation to do anything–which never comes. 
I spend most of my time looking for new games or TV shows or book series'. I've read a couple of books but hardly done anything else besides think. I had a horrible habit of being stoned at night time most nights and was worried maybe that vice was becoming detrimental so I stopped. But months later and now I do the same thing, lie on my bed waiting, but sober.
I don't know what this feeling is or why it's here and I am wondering if anyone else has had something similar and has found some way out? 
I'm starting a new job soon because I need the money during Uni, but i know working some shitless job that I couldn't care less about just to earn enough for my rent and insurance etc., isn't going to give me the purpose of searching for. 
Maybe it's loneliness; I am quite the introvert, maybe I'm growing older and need more people around me, but even then I actively choose not to see my friends a lot of the time. 
Idk, I'm rambling and just hope I can find some solace in some other floating person. ",1b49w6s,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b49w6s/floating_on_the_surface/

92,I am so confused with what is happening,"I have always enjoyed watching movies from the golden age of Hollywood and have a slight interest in the history of the 30s, 40s and 50s. For some reason there has always been this lingering nostalgia for a time that I have no relation to, I was born 60 years after the decades had passed. 


For the last year and a half I have been feeling pretty down, my main concern was what had caused it? I still have no idea what set it off. After 2 nervous breakdowns and brief periods of mania I became aware that something was wrong. 

Now with each movie I watched I would always look at their life purely out of curiosity and general interest into what life the had. For some reason after reading a certain actresses life story I became (and still am) exceptionally  upset. I learnt that they had led an unhappy life that got progressively worse and almost felt like a sick joke with how poorly they were treated by others.

I know that everyone was not treated well in every aspect of life and even now there are so many issues, but their story upset me more than anything else ever has. All it takes is to think of them and I get visibly upset, even if I am having an ok time it can be ruined with one thought. 

I have a weird combination of feelings that range from anger at the people that mistreated them, sadness at how bleak their life was even during the happiest period of their life to guilt at how I could have done something. I can almost come to terms with the anger and sadness but the guilt I cannot live with. I feel that I could have changed everything and fixed all the problems even though I had never met them. 

It's getting to the point where I can't stop blaming myself for not stopping it. I just don't understand why this certain person meant so much to my subconscious that it made me so sad.

Even when I searched in vain on Google to see if someone else gad this I couldn't find anything.

96,"Feeling empty and lonely, how do I cope with this?","
Three weeks ago, I tragically lost my partner to suicide. In his final moments, he shared that he was battling depression and despite thinking it had improved, it relapsed,, leaving him feeling like a mere shell of himself.

I'm still struggling to come to terms with this devastating loss. In the days leading up to the event, we spent time together, and there were no apparent signs of his inner turmoil. He remained his usual cheerful self, which makes his sudden departure even more difficult to comprehend.

On the day it happened, I was at work, and he texted me as usual, giving no indication of his intentions. He was known for his selflessness, kindness, and cheerfulness, always prioritizing others above himself. I've never encountered anyone quite like him, and I have countless wonderful things to say about him. Never ending.

I'm plagued by countless questions, feelings of anger, and guilt. Could I have been a better partner? Were there signs that I missed? Should I have been more attentive? Did I fail him in some way? These questions haunt me every day. He reassured me that his struggles were not my fault and that being with me was the happiest time of his life. Yet, I can't help but wonder why he chose to leave if that was the case. I have no understanding of depression, but I was wondering, perhaps he could've reached out.

Living with this pain has become unbearable. I've tried to confide in my friends, but their well-intentioned advice to stay strong only amplifies my sense of isolation. At times, I've even considered joining him, as a way to escape the overwhelming suffering. 

Our plans for the future now lay shattered, adding to the overwhelming sense of loss and despair. I've never felt so lonely and empty in my life, and this pain, it is just so unbearable.

so i just got back home from college when my dad asked me to drink with him. it was unusual because I would be the one who usually initiated these things. but i was like what the heck. ill just do it.  

so each of us drank a bottle. i, a bottle of sou, and my dad, a bottle of wine. eventually i got a little drunk but my dad was a whole other person as he usually is when he consumes alcohol. he would be this happy pill to the people around and make silly remarks and actions until he eventually went to bed and slept. but most of the time I could not shake the feeling of something wrong like im missing something. 

when our drinking session ended and as he went to bed, he kept saying that he missed my sister since she hasn’t been home in 5 weeks due to college. he also mentioned and asked if we would still love him even if he didn’t have any uncome anymore since he retired earlier than expected. he even questioned himself if it was the right choice. i felt so sad because by next year I am the only one out of my three siblings to still be in school. my dad is such a nonchalant and reliable guy that it is such an eye opening thing for me to see him like this. 

of course I love him with all my heart but I wish he would just enjoy his retirement and not think of the money. If need be I can provide for myself with the scholarship I currently have.

102,I collapsed at home and realized I could die right now and no one would notice or care.,"I write a bit of what is going on here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/iJASPexvn9 

But to continue. I have a part time job. It's not much but bills are being paid. My family still won't speak to me. My friends are still mad at me. I have one friend I text but she lives in the UK and I am in the US.

My routine is to go to work, look for full-time work on my off time, get rejected for every application I send in, lay on the couch, be unable to sleep, then go back to work.

I haven't gotten more than 4 hours of sleep collectively all this week and I had been taking every shift offered to me. Weekdays, weekends, nights, mornings, hell I don't care. Give me the hours.

Then two days ago, I had felt awful all day. I was sore everywhere as if I had been beaten up. I have chronic pain but this was on *top*of that. I lost track of how much aspirin I took just to make it through my shifts. I haven't been able to buy food, so I had a soda that was offered to me at a job interview for dinner. My home is a gross mess, so I decided to start small and clean the living room. I was organizing papers when my head felt like concrete and I hit the coffee table and then the floor.

I woke up on the floor, a cut on my head, a bruise on my face. My heart was going so hard that I could hear it between my ears. When I finally got up, and checked my phone for the time, I saw I missed a group outing the night before, then a face time date with and old friend. I thought ""oh crap, I better let them know I am okay and apologize"" but then I noticed that no one had texted or called at all. It reminded me of the accident, of the moments when I lost my job, all the things and no one reached out or even...noticed...?

It's occurred to me that I have nothing and no one. If I had just had a heart attack or aneurysm or whatever and dropped forever, no one would notice or care. I would be found by the landlord or police after a bill wasn't paid or something. I don't matter. I would just be written off as just some hermit lost soul or whatever people think of me. My parents would likely be relieved and my siblings would just be please to use me as a hashtag for clout. It would be infuriating if I weren't too exhausted to be mad.

I had one of the strongest panic attacks I’ve had in the last decade. I seriously thought it was going to kill me. As it was happening and I thought I was a goner, I was relived that everything was finally over. What is wrong with me?! I have a wife and 2 kids to take care of! How could I think that way?

Since that post, I was served an temporary order of protection (which got thrown out by the judge before we even got to court), I filed my own against her and her brother after finding texts discussing killing me, and I have spent the last 6 or 7 months fighting to just be peaceful and coparent because it's what's best for my son and I'm just so fucking tired of all of this. I just want to spend time with my kid because honestly, the only consistent moments of happiness anymore, are when I'm with him seeing him cackle and giggle and laugh and play. 
I waver between craving affection, and feeling incredibly apathetic and empty towards everyone. I have a good friend group, and I feel like a burden to them even though I haven't voiced how I've been feeling, because I feel like they can just *tell* that I'm broken. And they've honestly got their own lives and stress and I don't want to compile so trying to bring it up feels like a herculean task. 
I consistently feel... empty, and listless, and broken. I don't know what to do or how to get past this.

How do I feel whole again?

109,I think I just need someone to talk to right now.,"Hello everyone, I'm on a throwaway account because it's a bit embarrassing to discuss the feelings I usually keep to myself.

I don't really have anyone in my life to talk about this stuff with, most of my friends family life is not as dysfunctional. Nor did they grow up in similar circumstances so it's very difficult for them to empathetize sometimes with the things I say.

Most of them don't know what it is to experience living in a large dysfunctional house. I don't know when it started to get so bad. . . .

I haven't cried in a very long time, but to be honest. Whenever I'm sitting alone the tears come; I just don't sob out loud.

There's no escape, I either suffer under the roof of my dysfunctional family, listening to people argue and fight all day, or I get fed up and leave and have to survive on the street on my own with very little resources in one of the most expensive cities in the world!

I've tried shelters, it's basically a jail without bars! It was even worse for my mental health. I never felt so close to the void while alive. I can't do it.

This leaves me to now, I'm faced with a choice again, deal with my extremely dysfunctional family, or live on the streets.

There is no choice that doesn't involve extremely uncomfortable and mentally damaging/draining circumstances.

This is why I think I've had the thoughts for so long, because deep down In my mind. It seems much easier to just d** then actually have to figure this out.

I spent so much of my life just wishing I weren't born, I was dead or that, I simply didn't have to live this life.

There is no other solution, I didn't ask for this; I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either especially like this. .",1b483m7,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b483m7/i_think_i_just_need_someone_to_talk_to_right_now/

I have lectures to attend, bills to pay, food to cook, and so many other things that I have to do, but I do not have a crumb of motivation for any of those.   


The reason, in its essence, is simple: Why give a fuck if nobody's there to treat me like a human along the journey? I don't ask for anything too difficult. I just want to be treated like other people do; seen as a comrade, or as a romantic interest, or just someone enjoyable to talk to or hang out with. But that's not *my* reality. Fate decided my life will never be anything similar to that of someone likeable.

114,Idk depressed and alone,"Hello! My whole mental illness history is kinda complicated, roughly I am chronically depressed since early childhood and had a lot of heavy strokes of fate in my 20ies (am 29 now, f).. also late diagnosed adhd + autism… after my 4th burnout with 25 ending in losing everything I began suffering from severe ptsd until beginning of 2023… since then the chronical depression hits hard. (ptsd was overshadowing it a lot)
ATM my meds are working kinda well so I get stuff done, but since the ptsd is not a daily suffering anymore I somehow turned inwards a lot. Like I avoided toxic people (and most non toxic people avoid me lol) more and more and now I am most of the time completely alone since beginning of 2023..
Also my therapist had to move places in July 2023 and in my town there is no other form of talk therapy my insurance would cover now (it’s like 2 years ban after a therapy to start the next in the same field).
I have some really close friends (who live far away.. visiting them from time to time is all good I have) and also some other friends, but since I left the toxic people in my life, I don’t have people to talk about the heavy shit but also no one to just distract myself. Somehow to all my friends I am too often the therapist. That’s why I also stay away from friends more and more. (Also having already social issues with people in general due to adhd and autism)
Well this week I feel veryyyy depressed (especially today.. like unbearable void kind of depressed) and I have no one to talk to so I just share this here?
I am not in danger since I am depressed my whole life and had way worse situations where I didn’t k1ll myself. Yeah dunno I don’t need advice, just idk empathy or tiny social interaction? 
I wish everyone here a calm day/night!

 I wish i could tell someone all my problems and have them not judge or be afraid of me, i don't get why i got so unlucky and why i have so many problems and cant seem to get any of it solved. i'm constantly trying to be there for myself because it's not like anyone else will. I do things i enjoy but it's never enough, i'm never going to be satisfied. I try to be positive but what's the point if nothing ever gets any better than this? I don't understand my purpose at all, it just feels like i was put here to suffer because that's just how it's felt for nearly 5 years.

I know the only way I'll get better is if I talk about my problems but I can't do that, I'm way too scared. I have done so much to make this life worth living I've tried making new friends, going outside my comfort zone and doing new things etc... but I can only find temporary satisfaction in doing these.

134,My parents are nice but they can be so unknowingly cruel,"They’re both christian catholic, doctors and such good family providers. They can give me stuff I want and bring me to trips which I’m thankful of.

But they hurt me sometimes without them even knowing:

1. I was very destructive in my childhood. Broke or misplaced my toys during kinder to early grade school. I don’t remember what I broke one time but I remember my mom saying something like, “This is why you don’t deserve nice things” or “This gift is wasted on you.” When I told her she said something like that to me, she says she doesn’t remember.

2. Bullied at grade school. They told me to ignore it and it didn’t go away. They didn’t take it seriously, my school guidance counselor didn’t take it seriously. Got depressed and went into self-harm. My parents eventually saw it, confronted me, cried and pleaded to me to not do it ever again bc it hurts them. Told me to pray. I didn’t like seeing them cry so I said ok. I didn’t get professional help at that time. Just tried to busy myself w/ anything which worked for a while but then…

3. Pandemic made my mental health worse so I did end up getting professional help online and took meds. Partly because my school just kept piling on requirements and deadlines. When I opened up to my dad about this, he told me that every student is facing the same thing. Ok then

4. Currently in med school and tbh I don’t even know if I want to be a doctor. I got into skincare bc I had bad acne (partly why I got bullied lol) and my parents constantly told me I should be a dermatologist. Got depressed again. I’m failing almost all my subjects (<75%) and I can’t even care. Don’t like the culture and most of the people here in school.

5. Opened up to my parents about having suicidal thoughts. That I’ll never ever do it but I think & research a lot about it and the best methods. My dad told me people who do that are selfish and if I do it, that means I don’t love them, I don’t love my family. Ok.

6. Recently just told my mom that I think I need to take antidepressants again. She told me to just keep drinking vitamins and true focus supplements instead. Oh and keep praying + studying. I don’t know if I want to laugh or cry.

Starting to make peace with the fact that they’ll never understand me. Which breaks my heart. Also that I never had the backbone to say no so there’s that.

They did tell me that they won’t think less of me if I don’t finish med school and that they’re proud of my achievements ♡",1b3qs58,25,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b3qs58/my_parents_are_nice_but_they_can_be_so/

We feel like at this point suicide would be the best choice we can call a place but also we can go to the hospital because our parent would say is for attention so unless we do it they wouldn’t believe us that we need help. They doesn’t even want us to take our medicine for depression and anxiety because they say is not good to take so now we just think to take everything we have in medication like we still have we but can we want to be we just can and we our mad at ourselves to not do it we already don’t see a future like what make us waiting…",1b4dv41,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b4dv41/i_really_try/

139,I'm lost and hopeless,"Hello. I'm a guy in my mid-teen years and I have an insane amount of anxiety on a daily basis. Day after day I struggle to just live my life because of my anxiety always telling me something will go wrong 100% guaranteed or even worse that it already HAS happened and I'm being looked down upon. I really fucking hate this quality about me, and it's one I've been dealing with for YEARS at this point. Hell, I miss the old days when I was little and just a simple kid loving life occasionally being a troublemaker. Nowadays I feel like I need to be perfect, like every little mistake might just kill me. And the worst fucking thing besides the fact that I suffer the same thing daily, is the fact that I have no fucking idea where it came from. I've had a relatively nice life, with a loving mother who's done her best and STILL does her best to keep me alive and healthy, I have a house to live on, I never starve at home, nothing. Yet I suffer from this bullshit everyday and I don't get it, why? I don't have any friends, and the ones who call themselves my friends are people who have inserted themselves into my life, half of them i don't even like but again thanks to my anxiety I pretend. I rarely get physically sick from my anxiety except for stomach discomfort, but still it's more of a mental torture for me. My life feels like a repetition of gaining hope and then losing it, building progress then getting tired and back to square one, and it gotten to the point where I don't feel like living nor dying, I'm just there existing, I just feel eveything and nothing at the same time. I really don't know what to do and all the help I get is ""It'll get better soon"" but honestly even though I know maybe one day it will then I'll realize how I wasted all these years and then get depressed over it, like another cycle that I won't be able to climb out of.

142,I fear I might be losing my best friend,"I have been depressed in periods for a few years now, but during the last 8 months it has gotten worse.
And just to make it all even worse, I'm afraid of losing my best friend. We met during high school and we hit it off immediately. I have never felt so safe and understood by anyone else but him. However, things started going downwards since we graduated. He has said to me multiple times that we'll stick together until the end, but I don't believe him anymore. 

Recently I've been the one who always sends the first message. The one who even suggests hanging out. He has been busy lately, but I don't feel like I'm a priority in his life anymore, and it fucking hurts since he's a big priority in my life. I feel like I'm going mad. I don't know if I'm overreacting, or overanalyzing, or if I just don't understand his situation, but I feel so lonely and I need him, but he doesn't seem to need me. I'm going to talk to him about this one last time, but I'm afraid that we will go separate ways.

I just want to die. He has been a light in the darkness, keeping me away from these thoughts, but I can’t bear it anymore. I can't stand this feeling of being in a onesided relationship, but I don't want to let go either. If he's gone I don't see any reason to live anymore. I think more and more about suicide every day and I can't bear it anymore. I can't live in this disgusting world. I can't find peace in this meaningless void that people call life. I'm just angry, sad, and worried that my reasons to keep living will disappear one by one. 

I'm just tired. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to live. I'm out of energy. Every day I imagine a train running over me. And it seems to get more real every time I think about it. I just wish that I had something to live for",1b48cxg,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b48cxg/i_fear_i_might_be_losing_my_best_friend/

Hey, I don't know why I am posting this but what harm it could do. Okay, I am 18 year old guy and I don't see that I can live much longer. socially I am pretty isolated, I never had a girlfriend and I only have 1 real friend. I haven't seen him in a long time. He has new friends that he hangs with. I tried to be part of that friend group, they seem to like or tolerate me but I never became part of that group. I have actively wanted to die for 3 or 2 years I don't even know anymore. I hate my body and my social awkwardness. I started to go to gym to change my body so i could feel better. I have gone there for 5 years nearly every day, and I love it. it's only thing that makes me feel good. But its seems that it hasn't helped enough.

 I want to die nearly everyday, but i have to fake smiles and look happy so my family wouldn't get worried. They have so much shit to deal with, that I just can't let them worry about me. Every night when I go to sleep, I wish that I wouldn't wake up. I only live because, I know that killing myself would traumatize and hurt my parents and 2 younger siblings. I see that it is my responsibility to let my siblings have good and healthy childhood and teenage years. But living for somebody else isn't real life. It is just excuse.

144,Headaches from missing antidepressant medication,"I tried googling this and can't find any helpful answers. There's been very few days throughout the years that I forget to take my antidepressants in the morning and by the afternoon have an awful headache and feel a bit feverish. Like today. All I wanted to know if there's anything that can help alleviate my symptoms for the day. Pretty much what I do is, well first off take my medicine as soon as I remember to, then just lie down in the dark and avoid any kind of light, even from my phone. Oh and also avoid loud sounds. That helps but not much. I honestly don't mind feeling feverish but the headache really sucks, I hate getting headaches. I tried looking it up but google only comes up with answers about Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome, which honestly I didn't know was a thing. Problem is, this is talking about people willingly stopping or wanting to stop their meds, and the advice is essentially to either talk to your doctor about tapering it off or start taking the meds again. That's not what I want though, I just want to see if there's any way to stop the symptoms for that day, because either way I will continue my medication since it helps a lot. I've tried Tylenol but it doesn't help at all. Does anyone have any advice? Would be much appreciated 👍.

156,Sorry for the long and unorganized post. Drop any guidance or support that would help.,"Age 20, been suffering from chronic depression since Covid.
Little bit back story, I am from a South Asian country, grew up in maternal grandparents place with my mom because parents got divorced when I was a kid. Mom used to work  so pretty much I grew up with grandparents, aunt in laws l, cousins and friends. Specially during teenage years , I had a lot of friends.

Always had to financially depend on uncles, felt like a parasite. My Mom was always under pressure from the family because she was a divorced, single mom working lady. It’s a South Asian family as I said. Constant mental pressure on my mom which impacted. I saw her crying so much growing up that it took a toll on me.

Things went south before covid when my mom decided to get married after staying single for a long time. I did support the idea tho, because I thought she does need someone to spend the life with and Id have a family finally so I was happy.
Problem started after the marriage. Suddenly I got 3 fucking step siblings which I didn’t have a mentality match. It was hard to cope. Second, my step dad was an abuser and a lier. He lied to my mom about his past marriages and had more kids. He was verbally and physically abusive towards my mom. I went through these conditions for the 2-3 years, when finally after massive fight mom decided to get outta there. So, now I am fucking back again at my grandparents house. 

At that point, my mental was already fucked, always being financially dependent on my uncles or grandparents, constantly listening to their rants on how I am basically living off them made me feel like a parasite. I didn’t have any motivation, no ambition, no plans. Lost interest in all hobbies and things I like doing. Only thing was I had friends to share my suffering with.

Last year, after I finished my high school. My uncle who lives in Toronto wanted me to move there for studies. Paying for university wasn’t really an option for me despite me wanting to get into one. So I had to enrol in a diploma program in a public college. This way I can work part-time and save up for the semester while studying. (My uncle doesn’t take rent or grocery money from me). First two semesters fee were loans which I have to pay back later on my own.

I wanted to study software engineering. Firstly, the fucking asshole admission agent convinced my uncle  that the program I wanna take ain’t good and pushed some dog shit customer service program which he is probably was affiliated with. I didn’t get the option to choose what I wanted to study. I had to choose something similar so I chose computer engineering because the fucking agent was okay with that.

Finally moved to Toronto, excited for a new start. Was going with a great flow in the beginning. Not for long tho,
College life struck me with the first attack, I had no friends, these colleges mostly have Indian international students, they made their own groups with people only from their respective states back home. I tried my absolute best to befriend people but it just wasn’t working. Adding up, I couldn’t find any part-time job at that time. I started loosing that flow, my motivation went down, I was loosing focus, the depression was coming back. 

Depression finally came back when I failed 3 courses in my first semester. I chose computer engineering because of that asshole agent, I wanted to learn programming but now I was also learning Electrical and electronics engineering concepts, which I didn’t understand and had no interest in.

 I tried to talk to my uncle about changing my program. He refused. For him the education or certification didn’t matter. He just wants me to somehow get the permanent residency. Basically wanted me to go to one of those stupid career colleges which has no studying, which whould allow me to do more hours of minimum wage jobs and get the PR first.
On the other hand I wanted to be career oriented and not waste my early 20’s spending money and time on some useless certificate. Learning a skill which I could use universally is more appealing to me than a Canadian PR with no skills at my mid 20’s.

Second semester, again tried for  fresh start, but again, I couldn’t find anyone to even help me with studies. Started to not attend classes, became bed lock. Found a weekend physical  labour cash job. That whole semester I just lied in bed, went out so my uncles family thinks  that am going to classes, came back and slept. Again I failed a course and dropped another.

Semester 3, no motivation, studying something that I don’t wanna study, no focus, no drive, can’t remember when is the last time I did things I liked doing. Nothing brings joy to me. I spent my week just doing absolutely nothing. Chronic overeating issues, addicted to smoking and masturbating. Tried therapy around this time, didn’t really help. Can’t like talking to anyone. This point I am just numb, this numbness is just terrifying. Started having suicidal thoughts. Started smoking weed every week. Semester three I failed all 6 courses. End of the semester I started smoking weed everyday and I am still doing it.

Now, It’s my semester break, working 2 jobs trying to save up for fourth semester. 11 courses to retake while my study permit ends on fall.(Family members don’t know about this) Everyone disappointed on me as usual, caught smoking weed so they treat me like a meth addict now, can’t go out unless I have work. Haven’t met or talked to whatever friends I made here for the last 6 months. Don’t even wanna talk to family or friends back home. I am just isolated now, smoking weed actually helps me get shit done because normally I can’t pick myself up to get things done. I am just lost, I don’t see any future for me. My suicidal thoughts are really strong rn. I wanna live for me, live for my mom. Wanna get an actual good life. 

Please guide me, please help me get my shit together. I don’t wanna live wanting to die, waiting for the night so I can just pass out and escape reality, I wanna live a normal life please help me.",1b4ckva,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b4ckva/sorry_for_the_long_and_unorganized_post_drop_any/

Ah well anyways i cant get angry at all so i have to hold it but i cant, i could be done with my anger very quickly but my parents start with this silly fear mongering crap & threatening me or fucking guilt tripping whatever the fuck its called, that just makes me infinitely more times as angry, i feel my whole body just fill with rage & hatred i just want them to fucking die so much, im an atheist I believe in truth & common sense, i do not believe in fraudulent fairytales but i make an exception to that i wish they would die & rot in hell. This is what always leads to my self harm as much as i want to harm them something holds me back so i beat the shit out of myself, i also find it difficult to find words for things so i can explain things usually leads to more bs & getting screwed over in my life & is another big reason for my self hatred next to the other one of not being able to improve at anything & instead suddenly regressing when i do see some sort of improvement.

161,I really need HELP ,"I really need HELP

I am with my boyfriend for almost a year now, he's wonderful to me but I'm really concerned about his mental health. 
He has depression and anxiety in a very severe stage. I always try to cheer him up, make him feel safe to talk to me, find ""solutions"" that help even a little. He is going to therapy and he is taking some antidepressants, oh, he also is medicated for ADHD. For quite a while, it seems that nothing is helping, not therapy, not his meds, not me not anything. I'm really scared that he may even attempt s*icide. I can't imagine a world without him. I just wish I could protect him from all of this or at least help him, but everything I try seems to be hopeless. I don't really know what I can do, I searched about it but all the hints Google gave me I already tried to put in practice. Do you guys have any suggestions/went to similar situations? I really need help on how to help him!!!",1b4c9vz,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b4c9vz/i_really_need_help/

I try not to take my moods out on anyone else and i definitely can never dream of harming another human being. i sometimes fantasize about killing myself but ill never go through with it and this is only ever happens while or directly after a conflict or argument at home. sometimes i dream about bashing my head against the wall or drowning. i don’t imagine drowning would be a peacefully quiet end that im imagining it to be. carbon monoxide poisoning might be similar to what ive been attributing to drowning. i don’t imagine cutting myself or hanging myself. the former because ive seen too many cases of the remaining family and friends becoming permanently traumatized but the incident, not to mention whoever finds the body. and hanging is out of the question because i’m too fat. i really can’t imaging anything could hold me up long enough for me to suffocate. 

again, ill never attempt to kill myself, ever. 

but i do work in a very dangerous part of town and if i were to like get kidnapped or have my organs harvested, i might not fight it too much. at least that way i stop being such a burden on the people i love. they pay for my continued education and fit my bills. if i were gone, those expenses would be gone too. plus they could sell my things and make a pretty penny from that. maybe even enough to cover my funeral costs. i don’t think i being anything memorable to the table so i don’t think there’d be anything to miss. and i don’t mean this in a self pitying sort of way but i mean that i can genuinely picture their lives without me and im upset of their behalf that they have to put up with me. anyway, ill never commit suicide because i don’t want to put my family through that but if i were to be put into a situation where i might lose my life, i probably won’t fight it much.

It's like when you stretch your hand to give a dog food , the animal comes happy to get It's part and before it can take a bite you pull away your hand denying the food as you laugh. It's funny because i have seen things in real life.

I posted here some time ago , i asked for you guys to wish me good luck . I was at a turning point in my life , i felt like i had the chance finally to make things better. I was very happy that people wished me good luck and to my surprise things actually seemed to change. But recently everything turned out to be a lie again. I have always been a very unlucky person, my mom and my sister tell me. It seems like it doesn't matter the amount of effort i put in things , it doesn't matter my abilities,  something always goes wrong , things i cannot crontrol. I still live off my mom like a parasite, she loves me too much to ever abandon me and i am grateful for that. I am thinking of getting a job , make enough money and just live by myself but this is near impossible, at most i can get a summer job. Sometimes i get the thought of also joining the army , maybe i get shot during training because i know I'll never be able to do that to myself. Right know i feel down , no one is more disappointed in me than myself , i just wished i could get a chance to prove to my myself that i am not such a looser. I could help my mom out , my sister with her college tuitions a bit,  but nah, there is no opportunity ,i just feel like not waking up. 

I feel old, and with a setback, most of my friends will finish college soon, they are working,  some have relationships and they just seem to generally get to live life , with ups and downs. I get nothing,  not even a chance , i just rot in my room , my dreams feel too far-fetched sometimes,  i just want to give up on them sometimes. What puts me down isn't that i don't have the energy to do things , i have never had this energy,  i always did things on discipline,  still i am not enough to deserve one chance. 

I would appreciate any words of encouragement.

My partner of 12 years has recently has a stressful time at work which has turned into a full blown depression. We were supposed to be getting married in July, and now he's unsure because he says he doesn't love me or our 2 year old daughter anymore. Before this everything was fine.  
  
He is struggling to communicate so we aren't able to have a proper conversation. Has anyone else experienced there partner having no feelings for them whilst in the middle of an episode?  
  
I am unsure if I should cancel the wedding in 5 months time, we have put alot of money into it & have people flying in from around the world. But not sure if he'll be better by then or even change his mind.

So I started to just go and eat my food alone, and even though I felt bit awkward (of course you cannot just overcome it at once) it was compeletly fine. I felt comfortable eating alone. I didnt have to talk while eating to envolve in conversation, could eat on my pace(I eat slower than others), could listen to my favorite music instead of listening others conversation that you are certainly not interested in. 
Long story short, but I want to say that being alone doesn't mean that everybody will think that you are miserable nerd. Even if they do, who gives a shit?

176,45m Struggling with Anxiety and Depression,"This is going to be a lot, but I need to get this out. I am a 45 year old male experiencing depression and anxiety at the same time. I am married and have two girls, 9 and 12. I have tried a lot of meds and none are working. I do not know exactly what has brought this on, but I am struggling severely. All I want to do is lay in bed and hide. As soon as I do get up, I am immediately anxious.  I struggle to make decisions and feel like my memory is shot. My social life has all but disappeared. I am seeing a therapist so that I can talk through things, but I am not sure what I am getting out of it as this is my first time seeing one.  My psychiatrist seems to be out of ideas. A little backstory…I started Paxil when I was 25 for GAD and it has kept it at bay until recently. 4 years ago I started feeling pretty depressed, so I decided to switch to Zoloft. Since then, I have been on multiple antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers to try to even myself out. My anxiety was fine until I tried Lexapro. I had bad anxiety on it and it has not let up since. I am now taking 1 mg of Xanax to get through my work days, which I am not sure is very good for the depression, which is getting worse. I am irritable with my kids and pets and I feel like I am one step away from cracking. Either from the anxiety or the depression, but mostly the anxiety. I am terrified of losing my job. I cannot seem to motivate myself to exercise. I feel overwhelmed frequently. My psychiatrist seems to think I should try testosterone treatment even though I am just within the normal range. I am not so sure about this as the studies on it seem to question the efficacy of this and the long-term effects are not really known.  She also believes I should consider TMS which I may be interested in. I guess I am just reaching as I know a lot of people out there are struggling as I am and I am looking for support and any words of encouragement or ideas. I do not know what to do at this point.

185,Mind is a clusterfuck of nothingness,"1 month ago I was at my peak. Now at the lowest I've ever been before. Was there any specific event that caused it? No. Can I blame it on anything tangible and objective? No. 

&#x200B;

TL:DR Best way I can describe it is that I feel like I'm a very small, small shell of my past self. Entirely 2 different people. With no apparent reason. 

&#x200B;

Peak Me 1 month ago: Academic excellence, I would say I was pretty engaging, a social butterfly, easygoing, and able to adapt to anyone's personality. It felt like every time I was approached with a new topic I could easily bullshit anything and I was assertive. It felt like I had an array of dialogue options to choose from that all flowed subconsciously and naturally.  My thoughts were like a Michelin restaurant, with so many fine-dining pristine dishes to pick and devour. 

Then suddenly I woke up and it felt like I got a reset button pushed, almost like I was reborn and I forgot how to do everything. Checked it medically obviously, but nothing wrong with me. I had everything going on in life, a plethora of friends, supportive family, a secure job path. It's been a month, and I've spoken to so many people about it, tried therapy. It just sucks because I know that in the end it rests with me having to figure it out.  

I can act normally obviously with people, but it's just the nuance and nitty gritty of speaking to people my age, I can't come up with clever analogies or witty remarks to keep people engaged. I can't help but look at my past messages and just wondering how I could go back to that person I was before.  

Same cycle of advice: Eat better bro, sleep better, drink more water, exercise. Keep doing something to keep your mind off it. 

 

Literally nothing could go wrong, except that for the first time in my life it did, and it feels like I'm in a dark pit and slowly everything I've built is withering away and I'm just drowning in my thoughts and my demons. 

&#x200B;

I can't face my friends anymore, can't keep up conversationally, have nothing to add anymore even in a normal sense. I regret speaking to my close friends as I sense a shift in the way I'm treated, sort of like I'm special when I'm not.  Now I have a heightened fear of abandonment, and those feelings of being a burden for the first time in my life have crept up and are instilled within my brain. 

&#x200B;

Even when I was going through traumatic events, the one thing I held so dear to my heart was that I used laughter and communication as a coping mechanism. It felt like I could push through any obstacle. Till this day, I still believe that 99% of issues can be solved through communication.

It's all gone now, I forgot everything. Can't keep up. The sad thing about life is that it keeps going on and it's up to you to move on with it or not. 

&#x200B;

Has anyone went through a similar situation to me? How did you get out of it, I feel like no one in my life has dropped down to this extent like I did. 

&#x200B;

I also want to apologize to anyone reading this and thinking ""What is this guy complaining about, so many people here probably have it 10,000 times worse."" It's true, my life seems perfect on the outside, but inside I am empty. ",1b40efj,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b40efj/mind_is_a_clusterfuck_of_nothingness/

I was getting into edibles at the time since I couldn't get anymore medication and I wanted something to help me relax and focus. It was actually a point in my life where I didn't feel as depressed anymore. I didn't want to work at FedEx anymore and applied for a movers job but they didn't accept me.

Shit's just been a downard spiral eversince I dropped out of college and I have little to no motivation for anything anymore. I don't have what it takes to end it and cutting is out since I don't want to deal with the pain. I was thinking out downing a bunch of headache medicine but probably won't. Therapy is expensive.

190,I Envision a World,"Where everyone will treat me with respect
Will see what I am worth
Will compliment me when I do well
Will challenge me when I don’t
Will care what I write
When I want to end my life
Most won’t dare
To reach out when it’s dire
“Oh you can reach out to me”
On Facebook when nothings on the wire
But when it matters I see a liar
I see the look in your eyes
When I reach out and suddenly you’re tired
Mouth open, “Oh I’m hypnotized”
In a daze on all the days when I’m in the mire
Ears and heart closed but mouth open wide
It took too long to realize
You “live” the way you’re born
All alone and compromised
But what you don’t know
Is you can’t kill someone already dead inside
I’ll stay alive


Judge all you want, don’t care, had to get it out

In December of 2022, I felt like I really lost my way, and was still lost through most of 2023. I'm almost 27, and I know this can be a hard or confusing time in life. But as the only single person amongst all my close friends, and someone without real family in a world that has become unsurvivable on your own, I'd come to a resolution that I won't make it on my own. Once I've accomplished my goals, I plan on giving up.  
Based on my current goals, that would be maybe a decade from now, at the longest.

I don't feel suicidal. I just feel steady, and resigned. Is my depression making this feel so normal, and reasonable? It just seems stupid to keep fighting for a future that would just be harder. I don't want to do life by myself, I never have. And why should I 'play with the cards I was dealt'?

I feel like I can't tell anyone about these things either, not even my therapist. So that should be a red flag. But why does it feel so reasonable?",1b3vkhx,7,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b3vkhx/is_my_line_of_thinking_from_my_depression_or_am_i/

196,Do I deserve it?,"Where to start. I've been to about 7 different schools in my whole life, and I've been bullied in some form in all of them. It sucks, but I'm used to the archetypes I come across, so the behavior doesn't shock me and thus affect me as much. But it does hurt. It hurts a fuck-ton.  


I'm weird. I'm a weird kid, I've always been. For some reason, I just can't fit in with everyone else. I'll see other kids with their friends interacting naturally, but any time I try to be like them, and talk confidently and sincerely, I always get mocked or in some form ignored. It always feels like everything I say is off the mark, and I don't know why. It's terrible.  
But by far, the worst part of all of this is the fact that my dad is somewhat wealthy. I grew up in an average household, but about 10 years ago my dad got a job that got him a higher income. So to everyone else, I'm just a spoiled brat that lives on silver floors in a mansion. Because I live in a good house, eat 3 meals a day, and go to a high ranking school, everyone else sees me as a soulless spoiled brat, just like the terrible kids I go to school with.  


I'm typically lonely. I move around alone a lot. I don't hate it, but it doesn't feel right sometimes. Now I do have some friends from my previous school, but my parents are really strict and don't want to me talking to them. One time after a bad day of getting bullied, I facetimed some of my friends to cheer myself up. I hadn't known that my mom had just come back from a trip. Because I didn't greet her upon he return, she smacked her fist on the door to my room until I opened it, and took my phone.  


I feel like my parents are really bipolar. When I did something wrong as a child, they would sometimes give me talks and laugh with me, and sometimes they'd beat the living shit out of me. It's made me afraid of them, and I don't understand them. They'll be so wicked, whipping me like a horse, leaving visible marks on my body and face, and will cry over me later, like I'm evil and they're helpless.  
One time when I was 13, I told my mom I was depressed. She laughed at me and called my dad, who yelled at me and told me I'm on the internet too much. I brought up feeling like dying a year later, and she laughed at me once more, and called my dad. He started telling me it was disrespectful to say such, since my grandmother had gone through a lot to raise him and his siblings as a single mother, and didn't kill herself over it. After that, I realized they'd never give a damn. So up till today, I've never brought it up again.   


After I graduated high school, my parents sent me to this religious camp in a third world country for a year. The place was horribly unhygienic, and we'd eat meals the size of our fists. I'd come back sick multiple times, and they'd send me right back again after a week or two. The last time I came back, I returned with a UTI, Malaria, Typhoid and Anemia, not to mention the anger issues and sleeping problems. One time when I came back, I was going to cut myself out of frustration, knowing I'd be sent back to suffer in a few days. As fate would have it my uncle walked in on me, and told my parents after I had gone back. My mother called me on a phone and told me I shouldn't try it, as it's temptation from the devil. She told me my father had said I would never kill my self, as I wouldn't do such a thing to him and the family.  
One of the only reasons I haven't ended it all is because of my siblings. I love them too much, how would things be if I was gone? It would be selfish of me. Another reason is, my religion teaches that if you commit suicide, you'll go to Hell. Now no one would want THAT lol. If those two reasons weren't a thing, I would've ended this shit ages ago.  


  
Everyday feels like a 5th grader drew it, and then a 4th grader drew the next day, and then a 3rd grader the next, and so on and so on. Meaning they just get worse and worse. I don't usually feel genuine happiness, and I use shows, movies, games and comics to distract myself from the ways I feel. Like it's escapism. I feel like nobody really likes me, or gives a fuck about me. I think I'm really self aware, and I know I don't behave like an asshole. I'm empathetic. I don't say rude things to people, I don't talk about people behind their back, I don't put people down to make myself feel better, I don't do any of that fake shit. It's the assholes/bullies that do it, and it feels like the universe lets them get away with everything.  


Back to the worst part of all of this. I deserve it. I live in a good house, with good education, and I'm fed. It always feels like I deserve all the shit that comes to me, because my family is well off. I'm fully aware that millions of people have worse problems than myself, and I might just be a sick spoiled young brat. That's what it might just be, because that's what I always fucking hear.

198,The Weight of Constant Striving,"Occasionally, I find myself entangled in a web of introspection, questioning the internal pressures that relentlessly occupy my mind. These consuming thoughts are like an invisible anchor, ceaselessly pulling me down, making each step forward feel overwhelmingly burdensome.  
It’s a relentless query: Why do I subject myself to such incessant stress and pressure? Why does there always seem to be a voracious need to advance to the next level, leaving me in a perpetual state of discontentment with my present?  
Interestingly, this internal pressure has been a double-edged sword. On one hand, it has propelled me towards my current position. But on the contrary, it has been an avenue of immense suffering. A persistent feeling of inadequacy and lack of fulfillment has been a shadow, ominously looming over me throughout my journey.  
The poignant questions persist: Will there ever be a moment when I feel ‘enough’? Will the tumultuous storm of pain and uncertainty ever subside? Flashes of happiness make rare appearances, but just as quickly, they evaporate, leaving me grappling with my tumultuous emotions.  
I’m embroiled in a constant battle, a daily confrontation with my turbulent emotions, leaving me wondering if this is a solitary experience or a universal struggle.  
Navigating the way forward feels like venturing into the unknown. The lack of clarity is confounding, leaving me in a state of perplexity regarding the direction and objective of my continuous efforts.  
Seeking resolutions and mapping a path forward is the ongoing quest. While uncertainty reigns supreme, an unwavering conviction persists - the journey must continue, and the relentless pursuit of ‘more’ is an inescapable reality. Where its roots lie is yet another mystery in this complex narrative.

35 years old. 
University exam. Good job.
Two failed longer relationships. Last one with a house we sold. 

But, regardless of external factors I've always felt life is really hard.

I've been depressed, or anxious, since I entered my teenage years.

Always had it easy, mostly, in school. But never could do homework. Almost didn't get high school exam. I have for as long as I remember had a hard time Getting Started. Which is why I'm in the last stage of an ADHD investigation right now.

Have always been told stuff like how me being so smart shouldn't have a hard time. That I don't lack anything materially.

But the feeling is always that everything is going to be or already is f-ed. I'm never satisfied in the moment. I always want to be somewhere else or do something other than what I am doing right now. If I start doing something I'm not sure if that's the best way, most optimal training program or just not the most important thing I should do, which is why I often do exactly Nothing.

I don't want to have this underlying feeling of doom anymore. Is there anything do to? Can it be changed? I really don't. I'm so tired of it.

202,A short life story ,"Hello, I am typing this for anyone who can relate to myself, knows anyone in a similar situation, or may come across someone like me in their daily lives. Reading my story and providing any feedback will brighten my day…

When I was born I had a stroke which would alter my life forever. The stroke effected my right limbs which has caused slight motor impairments. I am unable to fully extend my right arm or move fingers on my right hand individually or bend my right foot upwards and I walk with a limp. I have difficulty completing tasks that usually require both hands, such as job duties or typing on a keyboard. Some tasks may take me a little bit longer than the average person, but I will do my best to complete them. Another downside to my lesser abilities is that when I’m nervous the right side of my body locks up like a temporary form of paralysis. This includes walking down flights of stairs, because my foot can’t bend properly to maintain balance or when multiple people are looking at me in a public area. 

Let me back track and give a condensed biography of my life from a young age to modern day at 24 years old. When I was around ages 5-8 I had to wear a leg brace to help me walk correctly. I would have physical therapy around this time also to strengthen my right side and have to visit the children’s hospital for routine checkups. When I was in school other kids would notice my brace and think differently of me. This made me feel sad at the time, but now I know I can’t blame the innocent mind of a child. It was difficult making friends in elementary, but I luckily befriended one other kid in second grade. It has been years since I’ve seen or spoke to him, but I’ve seen his success in life over social media and wish him the best. My friend from elementary moved away in my middle school and junior high days and I never made any other friends. I attempted to be the class clown in order to not feel like an outsider or loner. I was able to make others laugh at/with me, but I had no real friends and when I got off the bus after school I had nobody to play games or jump on the trampoline with. At that time, I found happiness in playing madden, wrestling, and collecting Pokémon cards, which I’ve kept to this day. During junior high (7-8 grade) I joined athletics to try and fit in with the “cool kids”. Long story short, I was the furthest thing from a freak athlete. I was one of the slowest and weakest kids in the program, but I pushed through. However, I met one of my best friends to this day while playing football. He was new in 7th grade and was kind of an odd kid like myself. This kid was very strong though and was a damn good athlete and earned respect from our colleagues. He remained my only friend until high school. 

During my freshman year I was getting bullied more than I did in any other grade. I would often get jumped at in the hallways to get a scared reaction from me, get shoulder bumped, get food thrown at me from across the cafeteria, or mocked for the way I walk to get a laugh from their friends. Not only did I have to endure this, but girls saw me as undesirable as well. This is where I developed social anxiety which I still suffer from, but for other reason I’ll explain later. During my last two years of high school nobody really messed with me and I was actually respected as a change of pace. The worst I experienced at the time were questions like “Why do you walk funny?” or “Why do you walk like you have a stick up your ass?”. When I told them the reason why I could see their smiles fade followed by an apology. However, I took no offense and laughed it off. I made two more friends at this time which I’m still close friends with today. 

In college I was able to obtain two degrees and even got to hangout with a few girls I met there. This was new and exciting for me because I never had the opportunity before. Still, I never made it past the friend zone. My social skills weren’t great, but they were improving. I would consider myself a decent looking guy, so I decided to try dating apps such as tinder and bumble. I’ve had luck here and there. I was able to go on dates with ladies I believe are beautiful and it was quite a confidence boost. I’ve had a few hook ups, not that I’m trying to gloat. I even managed to find a girlfriend on tinder, although it lasted only months. This may sound very depressing, but I have gone weeks without receiving a match and months at a time without getting a text or Snapchat from a girl I’m attracted to. I’m happy when I match with someone after having no interactions for awhile. Usually when I grow interested in someone they become uninterested. While I’m limited to only one option at the time (which I’m grateful for) I realize she’s more than likely getting attention from a list of guys. As of now, my confidence is pretty low and I haven’t slept with anyone in over a year. I rarely get compliments from girls my age and usually they’re sympathy compliments from women 65+. I rarely leave the house for anything besides work, getting groceries, or hanging out with friends. When I’m out in public and make eye contact with someone they usually look down or turn their head the other way. I rarely get smiled at, instead it’s groups of people smiling or laughing while looking in my direction while I’m eating by myself. I’ve even been asked by waiters/waitresses why I look so sad. I tell them that I’m fine and nothing is bothering me. It’s honestly demoralizing and I find it hard to smile. I find solace in video games, watching sports, listening to nostalgic songs, rock, heavy metal, and working out alone in the comfort of my home. I do get very lonely often and have had thoughts of (you know)… but I don’t want to burden those I love and am thinking of them before myself. However, I’m glad to be here today and to have typed a condensed story of my life.

I am extremely appreciative of anyone who took time out of their day to read my entry. Whoever you are or wherever you may be, whether you can or can’t relate to me, just know that I am blessed that you exist.",1b41btj,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b41btj/a_short_life_story/

I’ve decided, to hell with sobriety. Fuck trying to stay straight and arrow. Fuck trying to get ahead. There is no escaping this hamster wheel of hell for us single middle class folks. The housing market and cost of living have gone batshit crazy in my country. Every time I make gains financially, the goalposts move. No matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to win. Based on how things are going, housing costs are just going to continue to blow up in my area due to corporate greed and our incompetent leaders. I don’t want to date or be in a relationship, but the single life is just not manageable anymore (without at least one roommate) for average earners like me. I’m content with my own company but again, I can’t carry on this way financially. It’s just not feasible. I have no more work/life balance. I don’t want to live a life where I have to dedicate all of my time to work, yet never see any reward or benefit and never have time to do the things I love or spend time with loved ones. Renting is now extremely expensive where I live so that’s not even an option. All hope is lost and my dignity and self esteem have disintegrated. I’ve decided to quit working and spend all of my savings on alcohol and weed until my body finally gives out on me. I have about 3 years or more of savings to live off of. What was supposed to go towards a down payment will now be used to poison & kill me instead. This is me officially giving up. I’ve hit a new low and am too tired to continue fighting.

210,What is the point? I have nothing at all to live for,"Hi. 19F here. I’ll start this off by saying I want to die, plain and simple. I genuinely don’t see anyway my life could improve or get better from here and it’s all my fault. 

My family doesn’t believe in mental health. My mother has a history of mental illness and childhood trauma that she refuses to work through and my dad will never ever stand up to her. My two older siblings left because they simply couldn’t take it anymore and my mother still refuses to open her eyes.

I graduated high school and tried community college and was miserable there. I can’t drive because everyone simply refuses to teach me, so I commuted with a friend for the first few months but he dropped out because he was miserable at that particular school. Then my mom began taking me and you can only imagine how that went. I don’t think there was a single day I didn’t go into the bathroom and sob uncontrollably instead of going to class. If I wasn’t doing that, id get so high so that I didn’t have to think about anything and go to class.

I barely passed the semester and then dropped out.

I got a job so that I would at least have something to do but of course that was an issue. We get government benefits or something and my mom says if I work we’ll lose the help because we’ll go over the income limit. If I want to work I will simply be homeless so I have no choice. I’ve spent months and months looking for off the books jobs, and there’s nothing. I feel hopeless. I spend all my time in my bedroom crying and thinking of ways I can kill myself.

Adding on I got a credit card stupidly because I was working and thought it’d be good to build credit while I had a job. Completely wrong. I spent about $200 (on a $500 limit) and I missed a few $35 monthly payments and between that fee and interest I now owe about $700 dollars. I can’t pay it because I have no job and no way of making money so the debt will just build and build and there’s nothing I can do but dodge the calls and cry over it. 

To top it off, my grandmother lives between my house and my aunts and guess whose room she takes over when she’s here? Mine. She stays for weeks at a time and I can’t complain or I’ll be berated and made to feel like garbage. During these days I have to sleep in a twin sized mattress in my little sister’s room while my little sister is forced to sleep on an air mattress in the living room. She hates it and I feel horrible and I don’t want to sleep in her bed. 

I had a plan. I wanted to go to a medical school for 7 weeks and get certified as a PCT. It’s not the best job but it’s what interests me the most and in my area you can make about $21-$28 hourly depending on experience, but the school is about 25 minutes away from me and I already know nobody is gonna wanna commute me there, and nobody is gonna teach me how to drive so I’m not even gonna bother getting my hopes up. 

I just don’t understand why im still alive.  I’ve prayed endlessly over and over for things to get better. I manifest, I affirm myself, and still things just get worse and worse. I’m starting to believe that it’s a sign I shouldn’t be here because what’s the point? I can’t handle the pain anymore. My heart and head hurts. I just want to be at peace.

My days are the same. I wake up, shower, straighten up my room, smoke weed, go back to sleep, cry, and lately I’ve started self harming again because it’s the only thing that I can control. I don’t eat. I don’t cook. Lately I don’t even bother getting out of bed other than to use the bathroom. I maybe go out three times a month if my friends invite me somewhere, but other than that this is my life.

I don’t even know why I wasted time typing all of this when it is extremely embarrassing. I just needed to get everything off my chest for once.

216,Not sure what the point is. ,"So, not sure if this is gonna help but feels like something I need to write down. So who knows. But I've been doing this career for about 8 years now. I'm ok at it, I make good money. But recently the job I've been working has been giving me enough work for 2-3 people so I'm always behind. Then when the next shift comes on that usually has double the staff I get asked questions that I don't know the answer to because it was either too long ago or I never saw that patient at all. So I feel like a stupid asshole. Add on to that the crushing debt that my partner has basically entirely checked out of actually helping with even though the vast majority of it is there debt (think mid 6 figures, I owe less then 15% of the total.) Add to that my job means I get to attend people's deaths, Pretty much every day. The last several have been bloody gory deaths. And I have no outlet. I can't drink, it fucks up my already lacking sleep. I can't smoke, I get drug tested several times a year and clearing it out of my system takes about a month and a half. I've basically totally lost interest in video games cause none of my ""friends"" work the same shift as me so I was always alone and don't make friends easily. Not that I ever heard from them anyway. Eating is my only outlet, and I don't like cooking so that's an easy way to drop a bunch of money on food. On top of already being a fat dude. I'm just repeating this same cycle over and over again where I get sucked into a hole where it feels like there's a boulder on my chest for days. Then it lessons for a week or two, then I have mornings like this morning and I'm obviously completely incompetent and just a drain on everyone around me. I'm just so tired, all the time. And I don't know what to do about it. Already in therapy but it's inconsistent because it's expensive. No meds.

219,My experience with sexual coercion.,"for those of you who dont know, sexual coercion is a term used when someone is a victim of sexual assault. This may mean that you were pressured,manipulated or guilt tripped into having sex or getting assaulted when you didnt know you were. Moving on,

Around last year I met a guy that I thought really liked, and stupidly, I confessed to him when we didn't even know each other that long yet.  I think this was because he really manipulated me a lot throughout the time we were friends, which led to a lot. During my school fair, he randomly asked me if he could sit on my lap, and me being a people pleaser, scared to make him mad I just agreed, moments later he kissed me and I didn't really like it either. After that he asked me to touch him in public and covered us in his jacket while he made me touch his parts when I felt really uncomfortable doing it because for one, IT WAS IN MY SCHOOL. But if i didn't, he'd guilt trip me over and over again saying how i made him feel useless and stupid and I really didn't want to upset him. 

A few days later, I found out that he had been cheating on me with another girl, yet when i confronted him about it he cried and cried to me that ""he was sorry"" yet he didnt want to lose me. After this I eventually found someone else that I felt really safe with, yet when I told our mutual friend about my new guy, she sent it to my ex and he cried to me. He said specifically ""I felt like I've been hit by a truck rn"" when he saw the screenshots of me telling our mutual about me and my new partner. He told me he was going to lose it, so i really had to break it off with my new guy and get back together with him so I wasn't going to risk him killing g himself. That whole conversation was just him guilt tripping me into getting back together with him, and i really regret it.

This started a lot of manipulation. Every time he kissed me randomly and if i'd pull away, he guilt tripped the shit out of me and made me feel like I was a horrible person for not being able to let him do things to me. This happened for a while until one day, he manipulated me into letting him r@pe me, and every single time, I had to agree to it or else he'd make me miserable. I was pressured and manipulated into having sex multiple times when I didn't want to, I let him touch me when I really wasn't ok with it. My mom warned me and I tried to listen, but I was too scared at that point.

Sooner or later i broke up with him officially. And you know what i found out? he was cheating on me with THAT mutual friend who told him about my new partner. After that he had the audacity to say that he liked her more than me and that he should've said it at the start. He started a rant how much better she was compared to me and i lost it and just blocked him.

I was enraged, but I was free, but why wasnt i happy?

few months later i discovered that he had actually made me depressed in that relationship and gave me some ptsd. I figured out that I was also a victim of sexual coercion and that I was facing severe depression, i just didnt know it,  but hey, after a while i was doing better too. 

This is just a message to people who are probably experiencing toxic relationships too, if your gut tells you that theyre bad for you, go with it and stop torturing yourself. It'll get better.

223,Better off without me,"I just want to start by saying that I have no desire at all to end my life. I enjoy life.

More than financially stable. Own a home. Beautiful child with has the personality of an actual saint. It’s me who’s the problem. I didn’t have an easy childhood and in result, I have some anger issues. I’m short tempered. I shut down emotionally, easily. I have a tendency to put my foot in my mouth and cause problems. I’m the first to accuse someone of being toxic but “the call is coming from inside the house”. I’ve been in therapy for years and I’ve made great changes, I have worked so hard to be the person I want to be. Be the person my family deserves. But I feel like all I am is my flaws. My daughter would thrive if she grew up without me. My husband could find someone who makes him happy. He says he’s happy and adores me, but how could he. I wouldn’t love me. Sometimes I think about running away. Or I fantasize about getting killed in a car accident. Pulling a “gone girl” without the framing and faking a mystery disappearance. Why can’t I witness a crime and get moved to Germany it witness protection. I don’t wanna die, I just wish I wasn’t in my family. I love them so much that it would be like a mercy release. My daughter would turn out better. My husband could be happy. My best friend can get someone who is less negative. My brother in law would get a sister in law that he likes and doesn’t tolerate. My mother could focus her attention to my brother who needs more attention and help. My family has never voiced they felt this way, I just hate myself and my personality so how could I expect others to not feel the same. I’m sure other people on here have felt this. What do you do.

231,How did you escaped from the clutches of your inner demons? Need some advice.,"I am a 27-year-old female (as evident from my username; I forgot to use a unique name when I created an account here on Reddit). These past few days, I always find myself crying at night, especially when I am alone. Once, my mom caught me crying, and I told her it's just a simple cold. I resigned from my traditional 8-5 office job because of a particular ""person."" This individual holds a higher position in my department. She admitted that I am good at my work, but most of the time, she sees me as a parasite in the workplace. She consistently criticizes my attitude, but in reality, if I had a bad attitude, I wouldn't get along with my coworkers, and I have only received one case report against me. She is a biased person and only sees the mistakes I made throughout my career. I was not working as a regular employee in my previous job, but I enjoyed almost the same benefits as regulars. I applied for a regular position three times and always got denied. This ""person"" has an influence on why I'm always getting rejected. Last December 2023, I reached my peak. We talked face-to-face, and she was gaslighting me. It made me question my reality. I know for myself that I did not say those things, and yet she believed the reports that reached her. I tried explaining the incident to her, but no matter how I explained, she didn't understand me. I was mentally exhausted at that time, so I decided on the spot that I would resign. I did not even think through my decision. I just followed my impulsive decision. Even my friends and family convinced me not to resign, but I had made up my mind.  
Fast forward to two months later, I thought I was going to get a remote job, but I failed. If only I knew that getting a remote job was going to be tough, I should have never resigned and endured this ""person's"" perspective of me. Now that I am almost running out of funds to pay my bills, I started to apply for jobs in the outside world. I applied for an administrative staff position in a private hospital because my previous job was in the hospital industry as well. During the initial interview, of course, I did not tell the lady the main reason why I resigned from my previous job. I just told her that I wanted to pursue a different career path, and my long-term goal is to get a permanent position. As much as possible, I did not say anything bad about my previous employer. I haven't heard anything back from them, but I tried to follow up twice already. I think my previous employer might have said negative things about me, which is why I do not receive any updates.  


I feel so useless. I used to be so good at my job, but after 2 months of being unemployed, I realized I am just a nobody. I am willing to accept a job that pays less than what I earned from my previous job, and yet nobody wants to hire me. I have experienced 20+ rejections in applying for remote jobs. The private hospital that I was hoping would hire me doesn't respond to my follow-up. I don't know why our lives are miserable. My parents depend on me. I am in charge of paying our monthly electric and internet bills. I also have a cash loan that I need to pay. I know resigning from work without a backup job is the worst decision. I am left with no choice but to leave. I cannot take how this person sees me. I did everything I could in my previous employer; I always take home work just to finish on time. I even find myself working during holidays and weekends, yet they don't appreciate my achievements. It feels like they hired me because I was dependable and willing to work like a slave, but they're never going to promote me to a regular position.  
Another thing adding to my depression is our family's financial difficulty. My mother is a retired government employee. She doesn't get any pension until 2026. She availed 5 years of lump-sum retirement benefits. She already used all of her money and is left with nothing but to wait for 2026 before she could receive monthly pension. My dad is a rigger in the US Naval Base Guantanamo Cuba. I cannot remember how much he earns, but most of what he earns goes to my brother's medical expenses. My brother needs constant kidney dialysis three times a week. On top of that, he has medicines to take. He is unemployed, but he has a wife who is not willing to help him pay for his medical expenses.

But Zoloft left me with no sex drive and I couldn't orgasm at all. 

So my doc stopped Zoloft, started me on Wellbutrin. 

Orgasm and sex drive came back (maybe even better than before)

238,I'm starting to think that only people with mental illnesses truly give a shit about the feelings of people they don't know,"I know this is an overstatement and I don't really think it applies as a rule to everyone. I've met some people who I don't believe have ever suffered from any mental health issue and yet are super caring and kind and understandind because that's just how they are. Yet the more I interact with people from all backgrounds the more I think that only those who know what it feels like to feel truly alone and hopeless know how to treat people with proper kindness, or at least in a way that doesn't include the other person leaving a conversation and feeling even more shitty and worthless.

I've been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts ever since I was 13 and now to this day (ten years later) I think I can say with some degree of confidence that the only people who ever seemed to truly care about how I felt even tho they didn't know me very well (mental health ""professionals"" included) were those who I know have been through the same shit and know what it is like. Everyone else feels like they're from a different fucking dimension of emotional shallowness (which is something said by me of all people). I'm not talking about big shows of unearned affection or interest (which nobody expects from strangers or acquaintances of course), but I don't think it's too much to expect normal politeness and concern towards fellow human beings in general. Unless you have something tangible in common with them most people will normally not give you the time of day or show any kind of interest in your life and wellbeing at all, or rather they will but only if it serves them some kind of purpose (e.g. if you're like me and are neurodivergent you know how most people tend to treat us as comedic relief or simply question every little thing we do just to point out how weird it is). It's so painfully obvious how not only their interest in you as a person (which I think is legit) but their empathy and compassion are very conditional too. Most people don't really give a shit about how others feel if they can't relate to them and will not even try to hide it, but those same people will describe themselves as welcoming and kind individuals, or say they care all the while not ever giving you a second thought when interacting with you.

I think it actually all boils down to ingroup-outgroup mentality or something but holy shit is it that hard to be considerate about how you make others feel? Like how stupid do you have to be to not realize that you will meet countless people who are already this close to offing themselves but are still trying their best, only to have a rude and self centered person make them feel even more like shit than they already do? Just stop pretending you care about others if this is the regard you show them.",1b3cnuy,34,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b3cnuy/im_starting_to_think_that_only_people_with_mental/

241,I did it once,"M26. Back in high school I pulled myself out of my misery and got in shape, but then I had a motivation. I had a crush on a female friend of mine, and her constant praise and support at me bettering myself drove me forward. I didn't care about getting in shape. I didn't care about myself at all. The only reason I went from an overweight loner to a confident person who was the best player on our football team was the thought that if I could change myself enough then she would be attracted to me. I spent my entire time from 9th to 12th grade becoming one of the most physically fit guys in the entire school, heck I won our schools weight lifting competition. The whole time she cheered me on, and made me feel like I was accomplishing something. Then in senior year I did it. I asked her out one day after our football team won. I was so sure that she would say yes. I had spent all this time listening to what she said about what she found attractive in a man to her other friends, and I did everything to meet those standards. I have never felt as confident as I did in that moment, but of course she rejected me. She smiled and said she didn't want to ruin our good friendship, and that was that. Everything else in my life was miserable but the thought that I would win her over kept me going, and with her rejection of me I just stopped caring. I had spent years working out, and taking care of myself, because I thought I had a chance with her. In the end, even at my best, I wasn't good enough. I still carry that thought with me now even 8 years later. Even my best isn't good enough. I let myself go and slowly returned to being an out of shape loser. I even stopped talking to most of the other friends I had made on the football team. It is pathetic, but I never recovered. Now at 26 I am busy with my job and taking care of my elderly grandmother, so I have little time for anything else. I keep trying to get started on getting in shape and getting a girlfriend, but I just can't seem to find the time or motivation to do it. I feel as though I am unworthy of happiness. I feel like a failure. I mean I can't even summon the resolve to ask women out. I don't care about myself, and I want to find someone else to care about instead.

Advice? 

I don't think anything will help, but it is worth a shot I suppose.

If things get too bad before then I won't wait, but yeah. 

I have a very cheap, very failsafe method. Im going to buy it tomorrow in case it stops being available before my date. If I do it carefully and with some sleeping meds to knock me out for it, It's kind of scary how easy it'll be.

I'll go to a quiet, lonely beach, send out some messages, do it, then go to sleep. I'm quite happy with my plan.

I feel a little grief for the life I could've lived but there's no hope of accomplishing it anymore, so I'd have grief even if i chose life instead. I can at least slip away quietly with nobody to hurt and not be missed. I may as well do one more act of kindness towards myself.

I stare blankly, not noticing what’s happening around me. But the worst is feeling everything at once. Feeling too much inside and not enough outside.

247,Tomorrow is my birthday and I'm thinking to kill myself ,"Idk why I'm writing this in the first place.
So, tomorrow I will turn 20, and I'm really struggling with live rn. Since last year, due to the death of my grandpa and a huge flood that brought my family to many economic difficulties, it's only been a downfall for me. Past these events I was already in a bad spot, since I'm basically a school dropout without the skill to get a good paying job, and due to health issues I cannot do manual work. I already do weakly sessions with a professional in mental health issues, but lately it's been harder for me to speak to this person about my problems. I don't speak with my family about my problems, but they see that I'm struggling and they try to help how they can. But most than once I've heard them speaking about the fact that I'm a failure of a son and the're tired to see me in this loop of struggle. My sister basically hates me, she's in her teenager period so I don't blame her, but also I cannot relate or understand her because while I was her age, I basically became a shut in (now it's kinda the same, but for a while things where better, I think?).
I cannot and will not speak about this to any of my friends, since I don't want them to bear any emotional weight, also because him scared that this will ruin or change our friendship. Tomorrow I'm going to pass a nice day with my family, I hope, and during the night I will see if I have enough balls to kill myself. If not I will delete the post probably. I just needed some place to vent out my problems. 
I hope everyone that reads this post might be in a good situation for themselves and I wish everyone a happy life, without struggles. ",1b3s7y0,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b3s7y0/tomorrow_is_my_birthday_and_im_thinking_to_kill/

I have no support network. My parents are dead. They were unsupportive, poor and left me nothing.

Or given money or at least help, support and kindness. And I? I could never count on my family. My family gave me depression only and instilled insecurity in me for the rest of my life.

At the time I was unhappy with my work, my home, my health, my love life, I'd lost a lot of friends who left the country, and I wasnt really getting anywhere with my career.

I only have a few grand in savings (but live in Asia) so I took my motorbike into the country and just lived in farmstays and drove the bike through the wilderness each day. I'd originally planned to end it all after a few weeks of travel, but within one week I no longer wanted to die. 

I remember seeing a bunch of kids driving on a tractor, waving at me and laughing, and I smiled and laughed for the first time in months. 

Within just a few weeks I began to remember the joys of life - music, adventure, meeting people, drinking, travel, reading etc. 

I returned to work a month later and even began dating and functioning normal again. 

The only kicker is one year later, I'm back in the work grind, just suffered a break up and find myself struggling again.

I don't want to eat, I don't feel hungry or thirsty anymore, I am tired no matter how much I sleep and everything feels like a chore or burning time.

The only time I feel anything other than tired and empty is when I wake up from a nocturnal panic attack. Its this panicked sense of calm hoping its a heart attack almost, its happened a few times and with that plus nightmares I just don't wanna sleep. its not worth worsening my mental state over if i am exhausted no matter what. 

I don't have anyone to turn to, I recently lost them and I don't have family that can help. I've tried talking to a therapist, pastor and a handful of  councilors. I am constantly talking to someone just so I am not rotting but is the void really that bad? It almost feels like I have to so people know I am not dead.

Life goes on anyways and I try being positive but its so hard when the only fucking person you felt gave any remote fuck about you calls you selfish for putting yourself first as they asked!

I don't know what to do,because if i ask them to reach out, are they reaching out because they want to or because I asked? if it's because of the latter, would it still make me upset? I think i just want to prove the thoughts to be wrong, but i simply have no evidence. ",1b3trl3,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b3trl3/im_tired/

Some people think I shouldn't be suicidal because I ""have not been depressed for long enough, it's only been a year !"" But see, this is why I'm valid. I don't care for these rules of needing to be depressed for a long enough time, I don't care for rules I only care about the problem at hand. What dictates my suicidal ideation is purely the reason for it, not some rules about needing to wait. If you need to follow these rules then you aren't truly suicidal, it means that you're depressed but you still have some will to live, you still have some fight in you that you want to harness to better your situation.

Everything I've tried to do with my life so far has failed, I don't have a job, I've never been in a relationship and I don't even own a car. I can't be around people anymore because my anxiety's so bad that I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack whenever I'm alone in public. For a while I was getting better, I could hold a job and although it wasn't a very good job I did feel like I finally had some sense of belonging. Then I made the mistake of going back home for a job with better pay which was a mistake. I didn't mind the work but it was stressful and it didn't take long before a coworker dicided he didn't like me. The constant shit-talking and complaints about my work that was just complete bullshit got to me and after a while of trying to fix the issue I just gave up. I can't take that kind of treatment  everyday so I left and the next job made me absolutely miserable so it didn't last either. I didn't talk to anyone outside of what was needed in order to do my job because I just didn't want to have anymore problems but isolating myself made me feel extremely depressed to the point where I couldn't even get up to go to work anymore. I went to get help and got put on medication that doesn't really help and I know I won't be able to hold a job unless I get better. I've tried everything I could, I even got into fitness and made some real progress in that area but I still feel awful. I thought it would help but I still struggle to get out of bed in the morning and I don't feel any better about myself. I'm back to living with my family which I promised myself I'd never go back to.

Fast forward to 2021, and my dad gets diagnosed with metastatic stage 4 colonrectal cancer that had got into his brain as well. This sent me into the spiral I have not been able to get out of. I go to therapy 2x a week and hell I'm even a case manager at a local MHMR so it also makes me feel so hyprocictal at times. Anyways, my dad fought an 18 month hard battle and of course didn't make it. This led to my grief wounds being ripped open again and the bleeding I feel like has been even worse because of the fact that I was never taught how to grieve when I was 16.

I am really starting to feel invisible, like nobody would even notice if I disappeared. My friends outside of school have no trouble making other friends and I’m starting to feel like I’m just becoming a nuisance because they’re the only people I have to talk to. My mom suggested that maybe it’s because people are intimidated by me. I took this into consideration and put in extra effort to smile more, talk to more people, have a more approachable demeanor. This hasn’t worked and I still feel like a complete loser. I mean, there was an instance where I approached two other classmates and they flat out ignored me. I said hi again and this time they looked at me and just continued their conversation as if I wasn’t even worth saying hi back to. I make an effort to not say anything that could be interpreted as mean or rude just in case I’m saying the wrong things by mistake but I still get treated the same way.

I always cherished a small handful of people as friends but now it just feels even more lonely cause I don’t even think those handful of friends actually view me as their closest friend. 

Even at work, all the other coworkers got some sort of baby shower … I got nothing. Not even a little card or anything. No gifts whatsoever. And yet I attended all the other baby showers. 

My boyfriend works at my old job and they didn’t know about us until our second kid. First kid, they didn’t give anything to me but once we got the second kid and realized my boyfriend is the dad, they all gave gifts all of a sudden. It’s like no one wants to give me anything or help me out. 

I’m just destined to just go through life alone I guess even if there are people around me. My first child prefers my boyfriend/her dad.

281,Vicious Cycle,"Hi all, 

I (24m) have been dealing with depression and being overweight for years, and I believe they are very much linked. It's also a mixture of growing up with critical parents and attending a college prep high school and probably not being cut out for something like that. Lately I've been feeling a bit more depressed and maybe a bit hopeless because I just graduated with my bachelor's degree last spring, and now here I am back in school to complete prerequisites for a healthcare oriented job. It sounds like a really good career, but the schooling seems a bit daunting given my history of not doing well in science classes. I feel that I'm just not a really academic person.

 I'm hoping this depression is something I can work through and fix with medication, diet, and exercise. I'd love to hear about anyone else who's stuck in a cycle like I am - I work my job and feel depressed, then sign up for classes, then lack the drive to do well in those classes, and feel overwhelmed by taking two classes and working full time. Has anyone overcome something like this, or just changed their perspective and grown from it?

Part of me thinks it has to be my fault because one of our last few convos was me saying sad things & maybe I overwhelmed them and maybe they think I’m too much. It’s so hard for me to open up because when I did to my parents they’d usually just shut down whatever I’m saying and I feel like every time I talk to that one friend about something that it some how disconnects us in some way even if they don’t directly tell me so. It’s such a vicious cycle of never understanding how others actually feel and if what im saying could be affecting them negatively in some way. I try not to delve too much on my issues, I don’t usually bring up this type of stuff to people I personally know, but sometimes it just becomes too much and I need to let some of it go. 

I know I’m just rambling and probably overreacting.. it’s only been a few days but for some reason I just feel really sad about it. I feel like I’ve been kept out in the dark and it’s been really difficult for me to comprehend anything. I can’t even sleep that well right now because of all the bad thoughts I’ve been having. Like there’s a part of my brain saying that this isn’t a big deal and I’m playing constant tug of war with another part of my brain telling me that it’s all going to turn to shit & I just don’t really know what is real or what to trust about my thoughts anymore. All I do is cry, bed rot and distract myself all day.

Additionally, I experienced a horrible lower back strain in November and it has slightly healed but I think I’m always going to have lower back pain because of how weak my muscles are. Ever since then I have started getting pain in my knees, groin, ankles, and shoulders. I can still walk but at the price of putting more strain on my knees, ankles, and back.

I have had only had a few nights of decent sleep since my back strain thanks to the power of drugs. I fear I am always going to be dependent on them. I think about my future and know I won’t ever have a life of normalcy. I’ll will always be uncomfortable in my body and probably going to be that way until I die. I think about how I used to enjoy my life when I didn’t display any symptoms and was always  positive and patient. I don’t even recognize that person anymore. I grieve who I once was and hope I can accept who I am now. It’s only been 3 months so maybe I just need more time to cope and I hope I’ll find some way to mitigate all my pain. 

I have been thinking about dying a lot lately but I am terrified of the pain I would bring on myself and my family. Not to mention the unknown. My life could be a lot worse as well and I tell myself that when I’m feeling really down. It kinda helps but not really. 

Thank you for reading all this. I know everyone is going through terrible shit in this sub and I hope you find a way to get through it.

293,I'm drowning and it's my fault,"I'm in the second semester of my junior year of college. I'm struggling bad. I've barely gone to any of my classes, in one class i've done maybe one assignment, because I don't know what the assignments are because I rarely go to class.

 I sleep until 1pm most days, except now I drag myself to some classes because if I don't i'll be kicked out of them. I ace my tests and the stuff i do hand in comes out great, but that doesn't matter much when i'm not doing 90 percent of it.

 I got dxd with severe anxiety and moderate depression so got put on prozac 10mg this past month, and it was starting to help. I was starting to show up, do things i needed to do, take care of myself, until I upped my dose to 20mg, which caused severe dizziness and sickness and i couldn't go to class, and this past week i became so depressed I had to see the crisis counselor on campus.

 I lowered my dose back to 10mg but that was only a couple days ago, and right now I'm looking at all the shit i fucked up for myself. I've dug myself so deep I don't think there's a way out. I'm working with the dean of students and with my counselor, and my advisor, but I haven't met with the dean of students yet to work anything out. I don't want to take a break. That's not something I want to do.

 The sad part is? I LOVE the content in my classes. Greek mythology? Hell yeah! Archeology? One of my passions! But I don't enjoy them at all. I dread having to get out of bed. Part of it is because it's winter, it's cold out and miserable and I physically don't want to walk in this shit. 

But yesterday I walked OUT of the end of my midterm and left a note in the essay section saying I felt sick. Which I did. I keep feeling like I'm going to be sick, and my stomach hurts, and the dizziness is just wearing off now. I hate myself! I avoid my responsibilities and play around on my computer or talk to my friends when i KNOW I should be working on stuff, but i just plain don't, and then I hate myself for it.

 I feel like a prisoner in my own mind. I know the right things to do I just don't do them. And things I used to enjoy i don't anymore. Writing? I feel like the worst writer in the world, art? haven't touched it in months, cooking? I'm lucky if I can get myself to eat saltines these days. I've lost eight pounds in the past week. 

My room is a trash heap, haven't done my laundry in two weeks, in every area of my life I am failing, and I am a disaster. My GPA is for sure going to drop this semester. I don't understand it. I used to be an academic weapon! But now I'm an academic mess. Help. Please. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm trapped in this cycle of avoidance and self criticism.

294,"I'm at my lowest low, and I have no one. Needing to vent.","20 M. The last month and a half has been horrible for me. Been getting barely any shifts at work, and as a result have no money. Me and my girlfriend, who I loved more than anything in the world, broke up. I'm very stressed, and I don't think I've ever felt more alone. I can't cry, I can't feel happy, all I feel is a void, I can't feel anything. I just feel an incredible force weighing me down. Last night I purposely broke a glass and cut my arm with it, and I'm scared knowing what I might be capable of at the moment.

It's horrible. I've dealt with depression for as long as I can remember, yet December was quite possibly the best month of my life, I've never felt happier. Everything felt like it was looking up. I had plans, I was happy with my girl, and life finally felt good. And boom. January rolls around and bit by bit, everything falls apart. I'm so fucking done, I feel like I can barely function. I have to work tomorrow and I don't feel like I can do it. 

I hate being like this. Last few years I've done my absolute best only to look up, no matter what I face. I figure I only have one life, so I might as well try my best with it no matter what bad shit happens. Yet right now, all I can think about is if I'd be better off dead.

Reading other other people's experiences here, I don't think I'm depressed. I can still more or less function day-to-day, just that I struggle with motivation, self-esteem, hopelessness and constant exhaustion. I don't have any trauma or hardship growing up either so I think I'm just weak and lazy. I don't know. Am I just a fraud and faking it to take the easy way out?

Taking antidepressants also alters your brain chemistry, right? I'm worried about it affecting me negatively if it turns out there's nothing actually wrong with me.

297,Will do right by my feelings no matter what,"So I’ve been the most depressed I’ve ever been in my life this year. It has been shocking to get to this level of misery. And yet most days you spend them non-reactive, numb, like you don’t care. I’m not sure why. 

I spent so many months waiting for a message from her. The girl that broke my heart into pieces. Because I just couldn’t accept that she was gone. But I never did anything.

I want to make a statement about what people usually advice when going through a breakup. Not everything happens for a reason. In fact, the only salvation from suffering is that we may draw the strength that lets us consciously learn from suffering. But this isn’t a given, and it pisses me off that it is suggested otherwise. If everything happened for a reason, suicide would not exist. Rape and war wouldn’t, either. 

But anyway, I often check my gallery and Instagram stories from a year ago and get really melancholic and thoughtful. 

I thought about how my heart yelled for her to come back, to say something - anything. Everyday I’d open up my messages and feel bad whenever I didn’t see anything from her. An apology. A genuine apology. But things don’t work that way. Bad people won’t apologize because they knew they did wrong, or they never cared.


Just like I had fantasies of death everyday and felt like it would bring peace to all my suffering, having her say something really felt like it would help. But she never did. And I never went back to her, because she never felt sorry for toying with my feelings. And never cared. 


I guess that as a last act of respect and love for my depression, existential crisis and pain, it is fitting that she never came back. It kinda gives me peace as well, in a weird sense. I guess that a part of me died with her, because she meant love and compassion for me. She meant there being significance to romantic love. I am okay with it ending forever. A part of me has thought maybe from October to now that I kinda wish she forgot about me forever. That she never as much as recognized me if she were to see me in the street.

299,have you succeeded where i have not? how? and if not how have you learned to maximize your life around it ? ( kinda venty ),"man FUCK 

how is progress supposed to be achieved when it takes a hundred superman's worth of strength just to wake up before 2 pm take a shower and cry at the computer the rest of the day? 

well, hold on you say all that effort could be rerouted to more progressive actions/interactions. 

I don't know how I have never been able to resolve or cope with emotional turmoil very well I don't know if I was never taught how, I hate the words I don't know cause it's my only answer to any questions that really matter "" what do you want to do "" never knew still don't  "" what are your plans for the future "" dude I really don't know "" why aren't you like your sibling "" I could not tell you I really wish I could.

301,It would be better if I did not exist,"17m im genuinely a selfish cowardly waste of space, i was a poster child i got flawless grades, flown out all over the country for modeling gigs, lead in school musical, had an abundance of friends, essentially everything about me was perfect. But all everything went downhill after my elementary school graduation. My parents divorced soon after I was born due to my dad getting into a bad car accident leading him to develop bipolar disorder, after this he became an alcoholic and abused substances but he eventually got it together so I lived with my mom but saw my dad 3-4 times a week. In the summer of 5th grade it was fathers day and my dad didn’t show up to my house to come to the baseball game we had planned on going to, 48 hours later he was found dead in his apartment due to his drugs being laced with fetynal. This wrecked me as a child, I loved my dad and often I felt he was the only one I could talk to about things and he understood me more then anyone else. However as an immature child often I would get annoyed by his visits and push him away, this had and has led me to believe I only contributed to his passing. I had more people reach out to me then I could count but nothing helped I stayed in my room that whole summer and did nothing but cry. Going into middle school I was a completely different person, my grades were still excellent but I had much fewer friends and dropped everything outside of school and stayed in my room depressed. Then in 7th grade covid happened and it only worsened because I didn’t leave my room once for 2 years. Going into my 9th grade year in high school I had friends I could count on one hand who would often constantly shit on me for things like my “nerdy” hobbies, how shy I was, snd my physical appearance. From the start I hated school with every fiber in my body and went from never getting below an A in a class to failing all of my classes. My mother and step-father are the best parents I could ask for and of course sensed something was wrong and did everything they could to try and help me but I pushed them away too. Continuing on to my sophmore year, by now most of my friends had been with girls or were in relationships however I had never even received any female attention friendly, romantic, or sexual period. That became a new platform for me to get bullied on. Around this time I started getting into substances and have since constantly abusing them only hurting my parents more. At the end of my sophmore year I mustered all of the courage I had left in me to try to get to know a girl who I thought was beautiful and had interesting hobbies, however when first approaching her what I got was her calling me a creep and walking away. I again spent my whole summer locked in my room high wanting to end it all. Flash forward to my current state in my junior year i pretty much skip every class to go get high and run away from my problems. My parents have essentially given up on trying to help because all I do is tell them off and hurt their feelings. I hate that I do this and promise I wont do it again to them and I will change my ways. But I never do, often times I wish I had horrible parents so I wouldnt be able to lie, manipulate, and hurt them like I do. I spend every day rotting in my bed at home on weekends and breaks not moving from my bed. My physical state is awful im 115 6’0 and constantly feel like im about to crumble. I cant sleep anymore I spend all day curing myself and the society I live in like the insufferable loser that I am. At this point I have accepted that my end is near, death scares me but not enough that one more little shove wouldn’t throw me over the edge. Everyone always tells me that im young and I have my whole life ahead of me but this means nothing to me im sure if I kept living everything will continua the way it has been. Im sure no one is gonna read this but I just felt the need to get things off of my chest for once after all these years of bottling all these feelings up.",1b3nurf,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b3nurf/it_would_be_better_if_i_did_not_exist/

From a past partner, to old friends, and even my own father, they all just left me behind despite all the love I still had left to give. At this point I've given up on asking why they left and I'm just trying to focus on healing the huge wounds they left behind. But its starting to get so damn hard to let those wounds heal with depression weighing me down every single damn day of my life. It's getting to the point where I just feel physically numb to every emotion I have and I hate it. I don't want answers about what I did to deserve this, or why does this always happen to me. I don't care about those questions anymore. I just wanna accomplish everything I set out to do and make my family, and most importantly myself, proud.

I can no longer feel any sexual pleasure (can't feel anything in my penis) and have no desire to do any activities I once enjoyed. 

I've been sitting at home all day, mostly crying and moping over the pants. 

It has taken over my life and I'm not sure when if ever it'll get better.

It's the key to success, wear a tight dress.

316,"First depressive episode in months, terrifying feeling","30M, in my third semester of community college. Before starting college, I had lost my job that I cared about very much, and my mom was moved to a rehab center after having a stroke (she’s still there), all while my dad continued recovering from his series of mini-strokes. It was the darkest point in my life, I had turned to drinking like never before; didn’t shower or shave for pretty much the entire months-long ordeal.

Then I applied for college, for the first time in my life, and slowly but surely my mood started improving. I started working hard, and I still have a 4.0 GPA. I’m currently involved in the honors and Phi Theta Kappa programs this semester also.

Everything was running smoothly, until today. I was invited last minute to a trip to the PTK regional conference, and it seemed as though we were all set for me to travel next week. I was very much looking forward to a weekend of activities and socializing. But in the middle of class today, I get a message that they were unable to secure travel accommodations for me. To say I was devastated was an understatement. I just sat frozen, time started moving slow; I just wanted out of there. I bolted out of campus as soon as I could, I wanted to just go home. But on my way home, I stopped by the liquor store to grab my ol’ reliable from those dark months this time last year. I had to call my grandparents to inform them things have changed, as I was planning on staying the night at their place the day before I was to leave; but after that, I ghosted everyone. I ghosted my mom, my dad, and the PTK group for the weekly meeting. I couldn’t, and still can’t, bear the thought of going back to college next week and having to tell everyone plans have changed. Thursday is going to suck so much, I really don’t want to be there that day but I’ll show up anyway so I don’t get marked absent. For now, I just want to drink this weekend away.

It feels like a silly thing to be this upset about, but it’s alarming just how derailing this feels towards the months of progress I made in bettering my life. I’m scared that this current episode will spiral out of control and I’ll lose everything I had worked my butt off for.",1b3n8s6,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b3n8s6/first_depressive_episode_in_months_terrifying/

But they really verbally abuses me loudly for that sometimes even when the mac's on (discord) Also they tell me get out of the house at every argument. Moreover  my mother is racist towards my girlfriend (23). I cannot leave my girlfriend for her, she is too precious to me and supported me at everything for which i am passionate about, more than my mother for the last 8 years and she is probably the only one for whom i am still going on. Moreover, my parents body shames me because I grew a little healthy in the last 2 years. Furthermore, discriminates me with my younger sister a lot. She gets to decide her life choices at everything but i dont, even in the family matters. I dont have any argument with that But the verbal abuse in the family towards me is really making me depressed. At times they hit me physically as well and If i argue about it they verbally abuses me more and more. Even my sister does that too in front of my parents and sometimes at their knowings but they don't do anything about it much saying you are a guy, why are you complaining about it? But I cannot hit her which I feel unethical because in the end she is a female person and as a male I cannot hit her in any way right? All these are making me depressed at I get suicidal thoughts every now and then. What should I do? 

Ps. I had a pretty traumatic childhood. I used to get beaten by sticks and cricket stamps if I come below 5th position in class which I did 3-4 times. I also got beaten for other purposes as well (such as coming home late at evening after sporting events, stealing little amount of money like 100 BDT (0.83 USD) from my father's pocket because they never gave me pocket money but all my friends had that and they used to spend it on their small needs in front of me, going to friend's place for internet because I did not have that until college etc.)

I thought about, if any of my friend's parents do such stuffs and even asked them about it. But I couldn't find any. They post beautiful posts sharing how much they love their parents on social media but I don't get any motivation to that because I truly don't feel like liking them at times. They never truly supported me in any of my passions (drawing, streaming, football, etc.) All these pushing me towards drugs. I have some friends who does drugs for recreational purposes but I started doing it with them for my depressions. I tried talking it out with my friends and girlfriend but they all equally feel saddened about it and what else can they do? They don't come to my house because my parents ask them u comfortable questions about me and they don't want to put me in any more trouble after what I go through everyday. I feel all these are making me addicted towards drugs and porn which I really don't want but ... I don't know what to write about it. I am just stating my thoughts here honestly.

But slowly I am feeling like I cannot take it anymore. What to do about it? ",1b3mpi9,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b3mpi9/my_parents_verbally_abuse_me/
320,I don’t know how longer I can go on.,"I’m (19 M) just so miserable. I’ve been depressed since October 2022 and nothing has changed. I’ve had moments where I felt better but I just get sucked back into the depression. Anytime I’m happy I remind myself not to be. 

I don’t know what I can do to make it stop, I spend most my nights crying. I need someone to help me. A physical person to just hold me and make me feel better. I just want someone to care about me. Check up on me. I don’t want to end up killing myself. I’m scared I might. I feel like I have nothing to lose. 

I hate everything about myself. I never really cared about my insecurities but now I feel like I’m just a disgusting person. I’m so thin and I feel weak, I just don’t eat and if I do eat it’s just snacks nothing with actual nutritional value. I just don’t want to eat.

I’m extremely lonely. I go out at night and sit on a swing near my house listening to music making up scenarios in my head about how much better my life could be. These made up scenarios are like an escape, So I sit for maybe 2-3 hours on this swing just living in these scenarios where I’m just happier. I’ve been doing this for almost 2 years now. Every chance I get I go to this swing. Sit and just imagine and it’s not healthy and I know it. 

I don’t have friends anymore and I don’t speak to my family because I’m a very awkward person. I can’t be open to people. I find it hard to speak to people. I used to be able to but now I’m just incapable. My ex made me feel like my emotions never mattered so I just stop talking about them. 

I use to be quite hopeful for the future but now I just don’t feel like my life will ever improve I’ll just get progressively worse. Just end up killing myself like my dad. 

I thought I’d be more happier by now but I’m not if anything I’m worse. I don’t know what to do. I try to keep it in but it all comes out at some point. I just want to be happy. I don’t know why I can’t be.

325,Help me please. I'm done keeping my composure.,"So I am 14, and a guy, just to get that out of the way before I say something here. I will say something I haven't even told my parents, or my closest friends.

When I was about 5 or 6, this girl, who I am not going to say the name of, would come over basically every day. When parents weren't looking, or we were alone for a bit, she would touch me inappropriately, and had it in my head that sex was a normal and common everyday thing. This ended up with me growing up and believing that sex was everything. As I grew up, relations with family members, cousins, siblings, even parents were breaking. I always viewed everything in a romantic way, causing me to feel awkward around my parents. I never opened up to them, and I don't know why.

In my early ten years, like, 11 or 12, I got into middle school, meaning that we could actually see each other for the first time in years. Not only would she tell her friends about the stuff that happened years ago, but she would also pin it on me, making me look like a total fucking creep in front of some of my friends. I just recently found out that the way I am around people could be a result of what she did to me, taking my innocence at a young age. She took so much from me, and I can't get it back. I hope she dies a horrible death along with her friends who support her. Now, I discovered just a few days ago, that I may have nostalgic depression. I get really said when I think of times when I had my innocence, and wasn't to set on sex all the time. What do I do?

I never had a girlfriend, but somehow I also suffered from sexual harassment as a teenager. At the same time, I was constantly told that I was hideous. It doesn't even make sense, but whatever. As always, I feel like I am the worst.  
Then, during my youth, I had to shoulder the responsibility of supporting my family and solving their issues, all while battling suicidal thoughts. I managed to get through it, only to be hit by the pandemic. Later, I had to endure conditions like GERD and hernia. Fortunately, nowadays the hernia is gone, and I can eat almost normally despite the GERD.  
However, I feel almost completely alone. Even if something good happens to me, I feel like it doesn't matter because I see myself as a waste of oxygen, someone who is not worthy of love. I feel dirty, pathetic, and everything negative. Yet, despite all of this, I'm still trying to find a reason to keep going. but right now, I just feel so weak.

I don’t have someone who is taking care of me, someone I can talk to how my days have been, someone to hangout with or cuddle at night. I have been working abroad away from my home country for 5 years now. Living alone and having to take care of everything on your own is depressing. I have few friends here but they are all in a relationship, so most of the time I don’t want to meddle around their quality time. I had few flings but obviously it didn’t last and it’s making me more sad because of the way they are treating me and always receiving breadcrumbs of their efforts.

My previous relationships, I always got cheated on and left alone. Sometimes I blame it on my biological father as he doesn’t had anytime for me (my parents are separated) emotionally and physically. He can’t even fight for me over my stepmom (she hates me) and that’s the reason we stopped talking to each other unless I needed some help financially. I always say “if my own father doesn’t like/want me, what more other people do?” I feel like having a relationship with someone will solve this problem, as I always feel happy whenever I have someone beside me. I feel important and loved even they are just giving the bare minimum. 

A lot of people telling me to find a man who’s mature enough to handle me. But it’s difficult. Easier said than done, right? I’m turning 34 years old this year, single with no kids. Sometimes people are telling me that I’m pretty to be single. Sometimes I’m asking myself that question too. I’m currently based in UAE. Most of the men here were muslims or just after beautiful EU females or just looking for someone to have “fun” with. And neither of that describes me. I’m medium built, fair skin, Asian and came from a 3rd world country that produces a lot of nurses in the world.

Hi everyone. I just wanted to do this post because I just feel lonely and I have no idea why.

To start off with, I’ll try to summarise my life in a paragraph. Growing up I had a horrible dad who never looked after us, he never bought me anything and used to hit me, lock me up and never let me out. I’d get beat if I went outside. Never fed us properly and would leave the country for a long time and we’d see him for like 3 months of the year. He treated my mum terribly wnd cheated on her and he left us when I was 8. I am now mid twenties and I’ve been through a lot since then. I’ve had people dear and close to me steal from me, betray, use me and so on. I don’t want to go too much into detail as to what I’ve been through in case it becomes obvious for the people who may recognise me through this. But it in short words I’ve been through a lot of scenarios, seen a lot of things I shouldn’t have. I’ve seen things happen to my own mum, I’ve seen people close to me almost kill themselves, give in to substance abuse, depression. Ive been treated really badly in relationships in the past, but It is what it is. It just helped me become a stronger man. I’ve looked after people constantly my whole life and after I’ve helped them, most have left. The ones who stayed were my family because at the end of the day, they are my family :). I have a few good friends left bless them, one friend that has been there in my good and bad times since childhood. 

Sorry that’s long ^ but that’s just the absolute tip of the iceberg but I tried to summarise.

Now I’m at a point in life where I’ve overcome everything, I’m very successful god bless. I’m in amazing shape, I’m strong, have decent looks. I have my dream job, I have a beautiful car at a young age, I have my fiancée who’s an angel and we’ve been so happy together the entire time. She is my whole heart. I have my immediate family who are great people. Honestly, couldn’t complain about life, god bless.

But for some reason, I just feel sad most of the time. As loving as everyone is in my life right now, I feel like it’s hard for anyone to understand what’s going on in my head. I do open up don’t get me wrong, and they’re there for me. 

But for some reason I just feel like it’s hard for me to be happy, I feel so ungrateful because I now have everything I could’ve dreamed of, there’s literally people dying in the world from terrible disasters. I have so much more than most of the world.

But I just feel sad, depressed, useless. I don’t know why I feel like this? 
I should be grateful for what I have right? 
Is it because I’m weak? 
I don’t think I am because of everything I’ve overcome, but at the same time (in the most non-suicidal way) I feel like I’d be more at peace just being with god now? 

I don’t know if anyone’s felt like this before, but you just feel tired?? 
Like just genuinely tired. Maybe it’s because it’s been exhausting being there for everyone in my life whilst going through so much sh*T myself. I’ve seen so many things, I saved one of my loved ones from killing themselves, I’ve seen such horrible things, I’ve been dealt such horrible things. But I’ve always powered through it. I’ve been there for a lot of people in my life, and never regretted it one bit. Even though it’s tiring at times, but to this day I still try my best to help everyone around me, And they’re all very grateful for it. Even for the ones who were ungrateful and used me, I do not regret helping them out one bit and never will, and i don’t hold a grudge on them. Because at the end of the day, it was a part of my life journey and I will always want to help everyone I love, family, friends, lovers. 

Maybe it’s just all catching up to me finally? 
Even though I have everything you could possibly have in life, I’m still ever so sad. But I hide it very well from everyone. I don’t know why I’m so sad and depressed, why I feel like not being here. I’ve been in anti-depressants and beta-blockers (for anxiety) in the past.

I’m sorry that this is so long, I don’t even know if this post makes sense. But I thought id get some strangers opinions on why I’m feeling like this, regardless of what I have? 

Maybe it’s just simply depression, or ungratefulness? 

I don’t know, but who ever reads this and responds, I hope you have a nice day and thank you for taking the time to give me your  perception of your world and experiences in life🫶🏾

Without gaming, i can make progress on life, learn hobbies such as playing the piano(actively doing) but it all rings hollow.

&#x200B;

I just, I don't know what to do. I can't decide. I don't have much social contact so I miss the ease of communication video games brought. 

I enjoy multiplayer games I can play with people that aren't too grindy and just no games seem to bring me joy and I don't have any engaging hobbies I can replace it with.

347,I feel literally unlovable (24M),"I feel like I'm unlovable, I have zero attractive qualities, I have zero confidence, I have zero ambition, I'm introverted, shy, quiet, I'm not interesting in any way, I don't have redeeming qualities, why would anyone want me in their life?

348,Defeated,"I feel like today I’m at the bottom. While yes I have a job and great boyfriend- i’m struggling everyday.

All my coworkers look down at me pretty much- I know it’s a silly thing but they look at me like I do entry level data work. I have some of the highest education level on my team, not that I think that means anything at all most times, but they talk to me like I’m stupid and make jokes at my expense.

I struggle to find a better job- or even a good job. I have very few friends, I cry and am angry everyday. Like I feel like I’ve let that little kid in me down- the one that swore we would never be like what we saw growing up. Watching people do dumb stuff and have no self respect. Yet here I am.

I got told I needed to do 2 semesters of pre reqs to get into a 60k accelerated nursing program even though I volunteer as a licensed EMT for five years.

Every door I open seems locked - I feel like God hates me. And I wouldn’t blame him if he did. I’ve made so many horrible decisions. I feel so alone. 

I feel completely defeated. ",1b39fzz,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b39fzz/defeated/
349,I can’t believe I’m here. Again.,"26F. First time in this sub but I’m pretty familiar with being down. At a point I really had no idea where to turn.

Been working through a lot of things my entire life. When I say that I mean the trauma literally started within the womb (was born with neonatal abstinence syndrome/heroin withdrawal) . And honestly it only got worse from there. But the work I did? God I thought I’d done so well to work through the many many awful events and circumstances. I’ve had comments that I’m surprisingly well adjusted and people shocked I didn’t go off the rails. It’s been a conscious push forward for a long time and at least 15 years analysing myself in depth. Can’t afford therapy but occasionally have talked things through with friends who then passed on what they’d learnt. Point is. There were tough times but I thought it was the past and I really didn’t think I’d be back here. 
But I am. And I know it’s the loneliness and everything that stems from it. Cos of my trauma I find it really hard to attach at all. I have family members that are well. Around. But even the “good” ones (more neutral I feel) are people I just could never feel safe with. So I have relatives but no sense of family or support system there. I have no partner (years of casual dating and either heartbroken over people who just didn’t like me or escaping toxic/abusive partners early on. Thankfully). So all that’s left are friends right? The concept of friendship means the absolute world to me. It’s so important. But once again the attachment issues are real and they don’t fit any sort of pop-psychology attachment theory. It’s just my own shit. And now I feel like my friends are gone or friendships are falling apart. Most people have relocated and slowly the bonds are harder to maintain. Most of my friends also have long term partners they understandably prioritise. It just feels more and more like my relevance in my friends lives is disintegrating. And part of the work I’ve done (and might have done wrong) is to question the instincts that come from the hurt. So rather than self-isolating cos I’m sad that I’m lonely I tend to go towards. I will tell my friends i miss them and make an effort. And the more I make bids for connection the more it seems reinforced that my friends genuinely aren’t bothered about me. None of them are cruel or selfish or anything like that it’s just adult life I think. But my place amongst it all, entirely on my own is destroying me. And I can’t help but question how much of this is my own fault . And is it this inescapable thing i’m subconsciously doing to myself and will continue to repeat? And one of my biggest fears of all is that I’ll end up just like my mother - spiteful and deranged and forsaken by everyone who’s known her, this entirely alone. I know logically it’s likely I’ll meet new people and form new bonds. I just feel like I’m in a ghost town knocking at doors , no one is answering and the road is near its end. Like no one will be important to me again and no one will ever really care or look out for me. God I’m so scared. I need some tenderness. I need a hug. And I need a break from the everyday. But as simple as they are they don’t feel achievable.

350,I don’t know what’s going on and what to do everyday of my life.,"This all started in september, 2023. I had been smoking weed for roughly 3 months. On one night i relax myself with an 8 second rip off the pen. 20 minutes later, im in shear panic, feeling like my chest was going to explode, and as if i was going to die. I continued smoking, even though this was pretty traumatic to me. I fell into a pit of depersonalization, brain fog, and anxiety, that eventually led to what i think is depression. I can’t go a second without feeling down or worried about something, but i don’t know what that thing is, it just feels like a constant strain on my brain. Was the weed trying to tell me something? Will it go away if i’m still smoking? I just needed to let this out it’s messing with me.",1b3jsgi,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b3jsgi/i_dont_know_whats_going_on_and_what_to_do/

362,The future seems so dark to me.,"I don't want to go into my past trauma too much but I feel like a tldr is a bit important for context. I've struggled my whole life with mental health. When I was a child I was kidnapped and abused. When I was 23 I lost my wife and 2 children and took up abusing alcohol and marijuana. I've done everything I could to improve my mental health. I've been sober for 2 years and I've finally found a career for myself. I thought I was doing good. But the aftereffects of my depression have kicked in. When my wife left me and took my children across the country I stopped taking care of myself. I got up to 245 lbs (I'm 189 now...yay) but I stopped brushing my teeth. Now I brush daily but they're slowly withering away. I also couldn't afford to pay ANY bills. Now my credit score is 400, I have 3 cat repossessions on my credit report. I can't get an apartment. I can't get a car. I can't even get a secured credit card. I've become more financially responsible but because of my credit being bad I literally can't do anything anymore. My job is good but I don't make enough to pay cash for everything. I get insurance in a few months but I can't even afford co payments with how expensive dental care is. I can't even go to the doctor without financially ruining myself. The worst part of it all is I am so fucking lonley, I've done so much to better myself but Noone going to want to be with someone with poor credit, poor teeth, and shitty mental health like myself. I've kept so many details out and I spared you all my trauma but I'm starting to get scared. I hospitalized myself to handle my mental health years ago and I've genuinely felt so much better but I feel hopeless right now. I'm afraid of the future. I'm afraid no matter what I do I'm on the path to being alone and homeless. Not because I don't have money but because I don't have credit.

I’ve been modeling since i was 15 years old but 3 years ago unfortunately my career slowed down. i started getting depressed, eating disorder, anxiety… i started isolating myself in my room. i felt lost, i started loosing my passions and interest, i couldn’t understand myself. i was crying day and night. 
I stopped accepting jobs for months because i wasn’t mentally and physically stable at all.
I was always awake at night till the sun rise then sleep in the morning. i was either binge eating or starving myself.
No one in my family ever checked on me. my dad kept on nagging me saying how lazy and how worthless i am. he kept on talking loudly from the kitchen to my mom about me, for me to listen from my room about their conversations. my depression and anxiety became worse and worse. i felt helpless. no one was there for me.
Today my dad had me, my brother and mom talk in the living room because they noticed that my sister is developing depression too. he started talking by saying me and my brother should talk calmly to my little sister and never shout at her and he started blaming me again and really tried to blame my sister’s depression to me. i really wanted to shed tears, my whole body was shaking. then he started talking shit about me again saying why i can’t find job before when in fact i do have 2 regular jobs now. he kept on bringing up how arrogant i am that i look so high of myself that’s why no one wants to hire me ( i sent my cv to so many, did interviews for months but couldn’t find a job since in my country it’s difficult.
I couldn’t help myself anymore, so i started talking back to him and telling my side but i was having anxiety so i started crying while talking and he was so pissed about it. he looked at me like i’m so ridiculous. not even pity. he was gaslighting. i started telling about my depression throughout the years but u know what he said? “oh come on, you’re just lazy and don’t even try to excuse ur laziness by saying you were depressed!”
I was in shock but not too surprised. we kept going and fighting but he just never want to validate my emotions or understand my depression i had for years and he told me to fuck off and go to my room.. so i was like.. yeah that’s it. that’s my last straw.
i went to pack my luggage. not thinking of anything else but just to get out of that house. 
minutes later my mom went to my room and saw me packing. she started talking and saying is this how you hate us? i don’t hate my mom NEVER! but his husband? yes! i was just crying and packing my things my mom started crying. i couldn’t think straight anymore and i just said i think it’s better if i just die. both of you especially dad thinks i’m worthless and all so i better just disappear! me and my mom were crying so hard but my dad was just there.. he couldn’t care less. i told them i’m gonna leave or just disappear and my dad is telling my mom to let me do what i want… 
my siblings stopped me from leaving because of my mom. my mom said if leaving, she wants to leave with me too. i really love my mom and my heart was breaking when i saw her crying.
i don’t know what to do anymore. i feel so hopeless and tired. i don’t know what to do anymore…

368,Idk what's wrong with me ,"Many, if not all of you will call me a privileged prick and I deserve it for this stupid rant. I'm 26 and I'm in a relationship, I grew up in a financially comfortable family with a wonderful mother and father, I was SAed a bunch of times by different family members while I grew up( not immediate family). I was bought up as a strict Catholic after I hit 14-15 I realised I wasn't very religious, not religious at all really. I grew up with no friends I did very good at school and sports but I never had any true friends when I was 17 my sister died due a genetic condition and when I was 18 I left my country and moved to Australia as an international student. Like every other international student I started from the bottom and worked my way up during my degree and a bunch of jobs but my mental health was okay for the most part. I met a Muslim girl at work and we became friends and realized neither of us were religious so we got together. I lost my virginity to her and we fell in love quickly. I trusted her with every aspect of my life but she lied to me from the beginning she lied about her past, she lied about hooking up with a mutual friend(before we got together) that became one of my best friends at work. When I came to realize that she kept that from me I was devastated and then later on I found out that she sent explicit pictures and videos of her prior to them hooking up that he still has in his phone cause she sent it via messenger. I forgave her and stayed with her. We went through a lot of upa and downs and when her family found out about me they made her break up with me. She was my first love and first relationship but we got back together very quickly then when her family tried to set her up with another guy she broke up with me again over text. At that point I hit rock bottom and I tried to kill myself 10-15 seconds before I was going to do it my mum saved my life (unknowingly) she called me just to check up on me and I broke down and told her everything I thought shed be angry that I was with a Muslim girl but she was just there for me. There was a lot of talk about Jesus but still she was there. To reasons I don't understand maybe because I was fucking stupid we got back together again and after we did she cheated on my emotionally with that guy they tried to set her up with. I caught her and she apologized and said she'd do anything to be with me and she made good on that promise. She gave me all her passwords for socials and have been good ever since. 

Skip to now we both moved in she had a huge falling out with her family when she moved in with me. Her sister cut her off. It's been a couple of months and she cooks, cleans, does my laundry does the shopping and does everything that I want her to do, including sexually. I graduated and went into a full time job with good money and has got another job with my dream company at high six figures. My family all thinks I'm successful and I'm happy. The truth is I'm overweight, no confidence pathetic shell of a human being who puts on a show for people, even for her. I don't feel like waking up everyday and I constantly want to just end it. I have taken measures that if I finally do do it all my finances, student loans clothes everything will be sorted. I even have taken care of howy coffin will go back to my home country with no cost to my family. I know I sound like I'm whining and there are people with far more worse problems than me. I just don't know what's wrong with me, right now I don't have a reason to be sad or depressed if that's what this is but I just don't know what to do here.

375,I’m ready to let go.,"Depression can be likened to an uninvited guest who overstays their welcome, 
casting a gloom over everything and making the home within your mind feel foreign and uncomfortable. 
It's like a thick fog that obscures your vision, making it difficult to see the path ahead or remember the way back.
Depression can also be compared to a heavy anchor, constantly pulling you down no matter how hard you try to swim towards the surface. It's a relentless storm, with thunderous thoughts and showers of sorrow that can feel unending.
It's like being trapped in a maze with no exit, where every turn leads to a dead end. 
It's a shadow that follows you around, even on the brightest days, a constant reminder of the darkness within.
Depression is a silent scream in a crowded room, a plea for help that goes unnoticed. 
It's a war within your own mind, a battle between the desire to fight and the urge to surrender.

376,Life after arrest,"I am slowly reaching my life’s end. I hate myself.
 I am a foreign student in the USA and last year I was arrested and charged with fleeing and attempting to elude a police officer (misdemeanor). This was a huge mistake. It was my first time being pulled over in a foreign country, it was about 2am and so dark at night , and I thought American police use a different color of lights. I wasn’t even speeding, but apparently the police officer was so mad that I stopped about 1 minute after he activated his sirens. 
Up till now I have not received any tickets because I’m so law abiding. My case was taken to court and due to the nature of the case. I got a pre trial diversion without having to admit guilt. I did that and the case was restricted.
But I just learned that in America, whenever you get arrested, you are now a criminal with a criminal record, because there is no true “expungement” and I am so devastated. I’ve gone through therapy but it doesn’t work. I tried to kill myself too, but my roommate stopped me.

380,"My life hasn't gotten better in 5 years, it's finally time to give up on it.","As the title says, I've just completely given up on my life. The past five years have been the worst years of my life, with my mom passing just weeks before my high school graduation. From then on, a Domino effect of misfortune events. Had my little brother taken away in a super stressful custody battle against his step-dad (who I had a very abusive history with in the past). Then college starts, which should have been exciting right? It was for a little bit. Then I started getting extremely depressed and suicidal on campus, and I didn't take care of my mental health. That ended up costing me my spot in university, and all of the merit scholarships I accrued during my time at high school. Then I flunked out. Then I had to move and get a job that I honestly didn't really like, living paycheck to paycheck as a shell of my former self. All while dealing with family drama and the fact that I'm just worthless and let so many people down. 

Now, I don't care anymore. I know that things won't get better. I don't care if I'm selfish for thinking this way. I'm not gonna care anymore if caring will always lead to this degree of disappointment, frustration, and anger. Yeah. I'm out of a job now. Yeah, I'm homeless. I'm too far gone. My ambitions aren't worth a single damn, and I couldn't give a single damn right back.

And the worst part is? I don't have the balls to end my own life. I'm a coward who wants to die but is too afraid to die. So you know what? Time for an action plan. At this point, I'm gonna force myself to die through psychological means. That's why I left my job and became homeless. I figured that if I force myself into a state of complete and utter hopelessness, I could then find the courage to end it all.

I guess I feel like I have no direction or nothing going for me right now. I just graduated with a math degree and did some math education stuff. I thought grad school was the move but given how much work it is and my mental state, I think I’d probably commit suicide before I finish. I am having difficulty breaking this news to my mentors and team whom i worked with. 

They’ve done so much for me and i would rather dig myself in a hole than tell them I can’t continue on with the whole grad school plan. Its my own fault. I went to a conference and said how I wanted to get my PhD and start in the spring semester, but it didn’t hit me until I got home that I need to spend time with my family. I don’t have a mom and my dad isn’t involved a lot in my life so my sister and newborn niece is all I have. I just want to live with/near them and have be part of the family I always wanted. If I don’t do it now, I don’t think I’ll have the opportunity to do so later.

I can always go back to grad school years later. It’s just the thought of disappointing people who put time, money, and resources into me that hurts. Every time I think about breaking the news I get nauseous and start crying, jumping to these conclusions that I’m a waste of a person.

I’ve written in my journal, I do paintings, I do therapy and meds; these things work don’t get me wrong. But, I don’t see a sense in my existence. I am a burden to those around me,
and an embarrassment. 

I can’t look myself in the mirror, I’m on autopilot. My body is disgusting, my face is hideous. I’m gonna be alone for the rest of my life. Nobody cares, in a sense, that’s a relief. I have worked really hard in making myself invisible. As I get more hideous it’s easier. And older. 

I’m waiting for my heart to give out. I know I will not be able to do this any longer. My financial situation is terrible. My job is not going well. I can’t eat properly because groceries are so expensive. 

I’ve been thinking about going back to alcohol and sleeping pills. I’ve worked so hard quitting. I don’t want to do that again. I work out and I’m strong. But it’s not enough. It’s never enough. I also thought about self harm, haven’t done it. 
I have my scars from more than half my life ago.

I feel like I’m back in the 90,s with the rage of extreme thinness being back. I was perfect. Now I’m gross. Tears come out, but I can’t break down, I can’t complain, I can’t show weakness. I have to be strong and happy all the time. I feel my soul is dying. There are many things I love and enjoy. But, everything is becoming to much to bear.

I love seeing beauty, in nature and people. Animals, music, architecture.

I will never experience happiness or love, someone that truly loves me. Who could do that? I’m disgusting. And is that truly the meaning of our existence?

I guess this is just another day in bed. I will get up and work and smile. But I’m waiting for my death. I’m settling all my affairs in order, everything is planned. I’ll pretend. I’ll try. But I’m feeling lost, lonely and without any purpose.

Then I messed up horribly and did something stupid I missed two days of tryouts because I was overthinking like usual and on the 2nd day I had my first day of  therapy which was important so I didn’t wanna miss it but now I’m on a team where I know nobody at all and I don’t think I wanna stay 

softball itself is fun but my friends were the reason I enjoyed it so much now that they’re not  there it’s boring and lame and I’m not much of friend maker I keep my circle small with people I’ve known for a long time and I know it may sound ignorant but I have no intentions on making friends with just anyone I’m super upset and all my good thoughts are now gone and I feel stuck in a hole again so I don’t know if I should quit  and save myself from being more miserable then I already am or should I stick it out because the varsity coach said If I prove myself, be a leader and show I don’t belong on the other team she could reconsider 

but I feel she’s only saying that to get my hopes up cause I’m not an amazing player so theirs no way she’s gonna do that just for me I feel shes only saying that to make me stay which is working cause it’s making me hesitant on leaving I don’t wanna regret quitting but

I joined so I can feel some type of happiness but now that I can’t I have no motivation to stay and pretend 
 And being there is making me hate myself so much and making me feel bad which I’ve been trying to prevent

385,Why do I cope like this.,"Tw; domestic abuse, ptsd and ed.

I've realized something about myself that I only know because my boyfriend brought it to my attention.

This episode was brought on from my (21F) stepfather (M29) pushing me over a dining room table after I asked him to be quiet so I could do schoolwork. I then had to see my mother and him hit each other as I laid there, shaking in shock, and I still don't know how to process how terrible this has been for me.

When I get really depressed, to the point where life has me feeling battered, I will bask in my pain. Alone. I will wallow in it, and cry into my pillow until I can't anymore, and I can't eat because my heart hurts so much, and when I sleep I'll sleep all day, until my heart stops pounding and I can't stop shaking. The last time this happened, I was 19, and had lost 40 pounds because I didn't eat regularly for three months.

I know that I do *this.* And it's unhealthy. I know that. 

What I didn't know was that I push people away. 

I told my boyfriend (20M) of four years that I didn't want to come to his house tonight because I just don't want him to see me like this. 

He got upset, and we fought, and he said when I push him away he gets angry.

396,Trying to regain something lost or to realize its too late.,"Forgive me for the title, it probably took me about 3 hours to think up that silly line since I wasn't quite sure how to start this off though its probably it has always been easier for me not to think of how to start things but just to get into action as soon as possible.  For a brief intro I am a 39 (m) and I could probably talk about my life and traumas though that alone might exceed the limitations of this post alone its safe to assume at least I have experienced and witness throughout the life might be equal, more or less  to what others on this reddit might have experienced the only difference being it was myself who went through them and more or less my choices after those events and how I lived my life is the only difference.  Anyhow the only thing I will clarify when I was younger I had anger management issues, was insanely competitive in any aspect of life and always sought to be better than everyone else.  (perhaps why I got into games later in life)  Part of why I changed was an event where I did something to my baby brother that ended up breaking apart my family, the injury was blamed on my mother's long time boyfriend (this is an entire mess I won't get into since that my mother's burden and I at least have grown enough that I don't have to bear her sin as well as mine.)  This caused myself, my little brother and baby brother to go into state custody and I will leave that to rest but only add it was these events that led me to make the choices I did in my life. 

Before Christmas the company I had work for holds a Christmas party a week before and since I always attend I attended like every other year but something broke within me that night and I haven't been able to repair what broke.  Previously at any other event I am a very social person, being involved in the conversations and adding to them at times but that night I was quiet didn't eat anything and only drank two beers before the party wrapped up.  It was such a startling change in myself that even the big boss asked my boss what was up and was concerned since it was a huge departure from the person I am usually.  Safe to assume my time at work has been sporadic now since that party and I can't seem to fix what broke within me and not sure if I want it fixed anymore.  It pains me knowing the people at my work are hoping I get better and at times I think its better for them to let me go.

What I couldn't tell them was that at the party it struck me that I am tired, in my life I never formed any deep connection with another person and I had gotten tired of always walking away from forming anything with another person.  I am tired of people saying I am a catch despite everything I have done to make myself appear less attractive to people.  I am tired of people asking me of my hobbies since I don't have any and tired of saying that I just do what strikes my fancy at the time.  Tired of seeing people better than me dying alone knowing if they had the opportunity they could have done so much more.  Tired of wondering how much longer I have to endure knowing there is no end in sight only knowing that I have to grit my teeth and keep trudging on because what else is there.

399,How do I convince my tomorrow self to actualize my bright ideas when I'm drunk,"By bright ideas, which are actually normal for others and absolutely frustrating for me, I mean things like finding a new therapist, since I've moved to another city.
And fuck you if you tell me to stop drinking cause you clearly have no idea of what actual depression feels like. And fuck you even more if you think that you do know what actual depression feels like and you've been through it but still want to give me such an ignorant answer as to stop drinking or start going to the gym or it all starts with a small step or any of that shit.

I'm already used to changing my wallpaper to a big red text reminder of what I've got to do in the upcoming days. So it doesn't really work anymore.
I thought of a lot of things to remind me(or rather convince me to do the right thing). Like drawing a huge cross on my hand as a reminder, or even puting my whole hand in a bucket of paint for that matter, but then I would wake up the day after and think to myself I was drunk and uplifted for a little while, but in actuality I'm depressed and I can't go denying that, so it's okay for me to not do the things that I have to do. I realize that it's a toxic mentality, but that's me, as long as I can remember I've been like that. 
I doubt I'd get any answers that would satisfy my broken mind, but I would still greatly appreciate it as long as it doesn't have any of that over optimistic bullshit. But I'm mostly posting this as a deceleration that I need a psychologist's help so that it would lessen my excuses tomorrow for avoiding the subject. Still, would love to hear your thoughts on this...",1b3fxr0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b3fxr0/how_do_i_convince_my_tomorrow_self_to_actualize/

I'm so done. I have no clue what I'm doing with my life, I should be out of her house already (I'm 23), I'm not in uni and I'm not working (can't handle a job for more than two weeks lol), I'm only an economic burden, I have really few friends and it feels like I can't even talk to them because they already have their own issues to deal with, my OCD is out of hand and I can't even do basic tasks (shower etc). I wish I could just say 'fuck it' and act out on my impulses. I don't even want help, I just wish I could self sabotage but I can't if I don't want to hurt others. I'm stuck in the middle.

404,Immobilized By My Depression,"My depression and anxiety have always been a battle for me but I always have found a way to pull myself back up (sometimes faster than others) However, these past few weeks, months, years for that matter.. every time I get myself back on my feet I have a good stride of being me again then out of the blue life hits me with another bullet and I fall again. 

This time when I fell, I didn’t want to get back up. I am getting to a point where I feel like life has finally broken me. Why not just stay down so it doesn’t hurt so bad when it happens again?

Today has been the worst I have ever been depressed. I can barely think, move, talk. I just feel like a vessel of who I once was. And for the first time I’m scared that the person I was has finally wasted away. Now I just take up space and concern the people around me. I wish I was okay so they didn’t have to deal with it. I wish I could just hold this pain to myself but I do want to live my life like everyone else, I want to be excited for things. I honestly feel like I’m wasting away as life passes me by. I am only 28. I still have time but why don’t I look forward to it? And will I ever? If so how?

409,Depression coming back with a vengeance after moving apartments,"For the past year I've been living with my sister in a huge apartment, which has been good because it was sooo spacious, but we fought a lot and I found myself becoming more and more depressed from the constant negativity that I was responsible for. For months I haven't read any books, made much art or done anything that made good use of the space. I réalised that it would be best if I moved out while still being close with her. 

But now I'm gone and I'm waking up crying, my eyelids are burning from the constant tears. I keep thinking of my room there, her pet rabbits, and even the awful dead animal smell from my neighbour that permeated the apartment and I just want to give up on everything. I haven't felt this bad for ages and everything feels hopeless. Yeah I wasn't doing much before but now I'm actively feeling awful. I look so dishevelled and have fully stopped taking care of myself because of the stress of moving. I saw a picture of myself from a week ago and I look so awful. 

I should have réalised that changing my environment does little but upset my sister and uproot her life. I feel this great sense of having betrayed her and I wish I could take it all back. My heart feels like its been broken into a million pieces and I don't know how to fix it. Only I could take a beautiful thing ( living with family and pets) and uproot it and turn it into crying on a bare mattress in my new room with all my stuff in boxes around me.",1b3egta,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b3egta/depression_coming_back_with_a_vengeance_after/

411,Navigating mental health as a student,"In the bustling hallways and the silent corners of the library, where the air is thick with the scent of books and caffeine, there's a story unfolding that often goes unnoticed. It's a story that many of us share but seldom speak about. Today, I want to break that silence and share my journey through the often turbulent waters of student life and mental health. My story is not unique, but it is mine, and it's about time it was told.  
I am a 21-year-old woman who, like many others, embarked on the exciting yet daunting journey of higher education with dreams in my eyes and hope in my heart. What I didn't expect, however, was for those dreams to be clouded by an uninvited guest: mental health struggles.  
As exams loomed and deadlines approached, what started as mere stress evolved into something far more insidious. Sleepless nights spent staring at the ceiling, pages of notes blurring before tear-filled eyes, and an overwhelming sense of isolation became my new normal. Anxiety and depression, two terms I had heard but never truly understood, became my constant companions.  
The university, a place I had thought would be a haven of support and understanding, seemed indifferent to my struggles. Resources were either scarce or stretched too thin, and the few times I mustered the courage to seek help, I was met with long waiting lists and generic advice. I felt lost, alone, and misunderstood.  
But in the darkest of times, I found a flicker of hope in the digital world. Online forums, mental health apps, and virtual therapy became my sanctuary. It was through these platforms that I found not only coping mechanisms but a community of individuals who shared my experiences. They offered not just empathy but practical advice and resources that I could access anytime, anywhere.  
This digital lifeline was a game-changer for me. Slowly, I began to find my footing again. I learned mindfulness techniques to manage my anxiety, found online study groups that helped alleviate the loneliness, and engaged in virtual counseling sessions that offered the support I so desperately needed.  
My journey through the maze of mental health and academia taught me valuable lessons, not just about resilience and self-care, but about the importance of accessible support for students. It's a cause I've now dedicated myself to, advocating for better mental health resources on campus and raising awareness about the digital tools that can make a difference.  
I share my story not for sympathy, but to shed light on an issue that affects countless students. It's a call to action for universities to prioritize mental health as much as academic achievement. It's also a message of hope to those who are struggling in silence—you are not alone, and there is help available.  
As I continue my journey, both as a student and an advocate for mental health, I am reminded of the power of sharing our stories. It's through these narratives that we can break down the stigma, build understanding, and foster a community where no one has to navigate their darkest moments alone.  
To anyone reading this who sees themselves in my story, know that your feelings are valid, your experiences are real, and there is a path to healing. Together, we can create a change, making mental health support not just an option but a fundamental part of the student experience.  
In sharing my story, I hope to inspire others to speak out, seek help, and support one another. Let's make mental health a priority, not just during exams, but throughout our entire educational journey.",1b3eego,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b3eego/navigating_mental_health_as_a_student/

When i had depression before, i just fell straight into it and it was like walking right off a cliff one day i had no warning symptoms. I also had an addiction to SH and slowly became sober (1 year 1 month now.) i have been feeling so physically tired that i almost cant hold up my head anymore or even have the energy to say ""never mind"" when someone asks me to repeat myself. i was very happy about a couple weeks before this and i constantly kept my room clean. i am now procrastinating cleaning my room (something i used to enjoy very much) am too tired to do anything but sit in my bed, and as soon as i come home from school i sit down and scroll on instagram until i go to sleep. i have also been very very irritable and i cry over little things that dont matter. i have a subtle voice telling me that my friends think im rude/annoying/bitchy etc, and i dont know if im actually depressed or just feeling this way for one reason or another. i also am way too scared to ask my parents to see a doctor because my mom always brushes it off and says im being dramatic or she usually says she will get me an appointment and literally has never done that and will never. please give advice or lmk if you think i could have depression.

You have a dream but when you wake up, you forget it immediately and it leaves just a darkness where memories are supposed to be. Simular to how sensitive documents have been marked to conceal certain information. It's a surreal feeling that I wish I could get rid of. It's the feeling of not being sure if you are still in one or not. You then have this constant urge to take a gamble to end it all to see if you are still in one but at the same time are afraid that if you aren't in one, you made a grave mistake. That urge gets bigger every moment i think about it. it's been on my mind alot. There's this feeling of indifference towards others feelings and it's getting hard to pretend that i care when i don't.

420,I feel hopeless,"Buckle up this is a long post, but I’d appreciate the read and some feedback or even just some kind words. 

I’m 21, suffered from severe depression and anxiety since middle school, & I’ve dropped out of college twice. Almost as soon as I finally enrolled in esthetician school and had some hope for my life (I’ve wanted to be a makeup artist since I was a kid), my health starts acting up. I’ve had random health problems since I was a kid but they’ve always been pretty manageable, my mental health was always more debilitating. 
However, a month into my 6 month program, my health started taking a steady decline, I’ve missed so much school due to bad days and doc appointments and we’re still not sure what’s going on or found anything to help manage it. I’ve lost 10 pounds in a month (I’ve been the same weight since freshman year of high school), got diagnosed with central sleep apnea, which is just fantastic cause now I have another thing to be anxious about and there’s no way to help me being exhausted all the time rn, I think I have insomnia which doesn’t help at all, and now I’m about 2 months behind in school. 
I can’t just graduate anyways, I have to make up those hours so now I’m stuck here longer and dealing with everything. My class days are 9am-5:30pm every single day and I’m suffering. I’ve already taken a few weeks health break & being behind is making me anxious to go to class which is making me miss more and then the cycle repeats, & my grad date gets pushed farther back. 
I’ve talked with my school in depth and shown doctor notes and gotten only minimal accommodations, I don’t want to drop out but I’m at an all time low in my physical and mental health. I just don’t know what to do. Everything feels pointless bc I always get kicked back down once I’ve gained some hope for my life and happiness. On top of it, I moved to a new city for this school and have no friends and know no one but my sister, I’m an introvert but my mental health is getting in the way of even wanting to go out or attempt to meet people so even though I’m content by myself, I’m getting so lonely and becoming a miserable vegetable. 
I thought I had a rough freshman year of college, but this is 100x worse and I’m drowning. I hate everyday, and I’m just so so… sad. I can’t stand it. 
So yea that’s it, sorry if u made it this far, I just needed to tell someone because no one in my family or friends can understand what I’m going through.

421,Trouble Waking Up,"It's getting harder and harder to get out of bed. My dreams before my alarm are so vivid. And I'm always surrounded by people. People that seem to like me. I hit snooze 2-3 times and between each is a new dream and a new set of friends or family members.

Then eventually I have to drag myself out of bed. Get ready to work, where I sit in a cubicle alone all day. I've lost half my motivation to work so now I'm anxious that I don't do enough. I try to put some work in, but in the end I'm a lazy pos. I make careless mistakes when I try, and I am pretty sure I am going to be disciplined on one today.

423,Tornado year.  Need to vent. ,"March 2023: found out I was pregnant with our “ours baby”. We have 4 other kids, combined. (Me two boys and him 2 girls) The youngest being 10 at the time. I waso verwhelmed by the idea of starting over. 

Over the next few weeks I had complications and after several doctor’s appointments and screenings I was told that I miscarried.

 I had terrible hemorrhaging that hid her heartbeat from view. At my last appointment they sent me to am the hospital for an ultrasound to decide if I needed a DNC. The tech found a heartbeat. I hadn’t miscarried  but they were not confident that it was a viable pregnancy. Nobody knew but me and my husband. 

April- my boy’s biological father was murdered by his wife’s affair. Shot in the back of the head when he came home from work early. 
We had just closed on a house and were in the middle of moving when this happened. My boys spent 12 weeks going to therapy. It was a difficult difficult time. 

We spent the summer going to therapy, drs appointments, and renovating the house. We had to wait nearly 4 months along to tell them about the baby because I couldn’t bear to let them lose someone else. 

I am a muralist and painted 9 of them in 2023. My biggest I had waited months to start because of payment delays with the city. 

The house we bought was a  flipper. We started showing in October. Balancing the turmoil, pregnancy, and real estate doing the holidays was very hard. We had family staying with us for several weeks during that time.  

We barely made it through Thanksgiving and I finally, at 8 months pregnant, was able to start the final and largest mural. I desperately needed to because we were having financial issues with everything going on. I painted for 2 days and went into early labor. 

My daughter was born at 36 weeks via emergency C-section; thankfully very healthy. 

Newborn life and Christmas. Everyone I worked with had pretty much ghosted me when I was unable to fulfill their needs during this time. Life went silent. 

I’m now 3 months postpartum and haven’t been able to get back to the mural and it’s bothering me so much that it sits unfinished. I homeschool everyone and my husband works full time. 

The kiddos are ask doing amazingly well … I just feel so overwhelmed, burnt out, and alone. I have maybe two friends other than my husband but we haven’t been close in years so I don’t feel like I can talk to them about this.

I am a 36-year-old man with a great wife who has been struggling for a while. I don't know where to start. I have two degrees and I have no idea who I should contact to start the process of getting better. I feel like I should know what my next steps are. I have no insurance. My last job closed/is moving. I'm waiting until March 15 to start a new job in the same industry. It seems to me like I should be alright. Things aren't terrible.

Except for the complete lack of motivation and the loss of my interests. Sometimes I go on autopilot to ""enjoy"" a game for a while, but it only passes the time. I want to sleep almost always. Just woke up for the day? Time to sleep some more. Nothing you want to watch? Just a little nap. 

My wife doesn't seem to understand either. I don't think she has experienced something like this. I feel like my feelings don't matter most of the time. I will always choose what others want to do because my opinion is the least important. I've always felt unimportant. Not like I wanted to be important, but the absence of feeling like anyone cares what I think or want. I don't know if I have trauma, but the ACE questionnaire thinks I do. Where do I go? Who do I ask to talk to? The last 2 times I asked my primary doctor about therapists/psychiatrists I was sent to counselors.

430,I’ve had constant cycles of depression for 6/7 years now ,"I’m 19 now and have had many times where I’ve felt dissociated from society and the people around me. Many moments where I feel almost numb but still have a blunt feeling in my chest. Constant thoughts and panics about the past or the future.

I feel it’s managed to become less and less frequent as I’ve moved out of my parents place to go to uni, but I had a bout of depression recently where I started to question whether my friends actually liked me, whether I’m good enough, etc, all the stuff to do with anxiety. That anxiety made me just complain about life and how shit it is when in reality it’s pretty neutral. I started to associate negative feelings with all the experiences in my life and that was actually causing a lot of harm. 

But since then, I’ve been trying to actively think about the present moment. Generally I’m in my head constantly thinking about the worst case scenarios and stuff but recently I’ve tried to just think like, “look at those trees, they’re actually really beautiful” and stuff like that. Just trying to put a positive spin on stuff.

It did help me feel happier in general but I still feel like it’s almost a piece of me to be depressed. Like, I’m out of my comfort zone and feel like I’m not me when I’m not depressed. ",1b36i8z,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b36i8z/ive_had_constant_cycles_of_depression_for_67/

Last time I did (I don’t do it often, maybe once every two months or so) he told me in a polite way to either fix the problems or stop coming to him and crying about it. And maybe I misunderstood, but that’s what I took it all. I feel like I’m on eggshells with him the last few days because he can clearly tell somethings wrong, but I refuse to talk with him about it. I’m tired of putting it on him all the time.
I’m tired of existing, I think. I haven’t felt this worthless and like an utter nuisance in a long time. I feel like others around me would be better off if I vanished. I’m not suicidal, but I’m wondering how better everyone would be if I wasn’t around. Like I just pooped one day.

I'm always stuck in a loop of procrastinating and hating myself and feeling guilty. Getting a weekly planner worked at first. I was almost excited for it, I got a pretty one that I could customize. It felt like it was the answer to everything! Then I realised that no matter how much I want to write down stuff, I simply don't have the mental capacity to actually do it. And it was a huge let down.

440,Intense Waves of Utter Despair-Can Anyone Help?,"Reaching out here because I am struggling with experiencing these intense waves of utter despair and feelings of complete hopelessness and darkness and could use any encouragement or advice or acknowledgement. Really, anything at this point. I will even take insults. I am feeling like a complete and total failure at everything in life and irredeemably worthless.

If you look at me on the outside, you will see someone who seems to have everything together. I am privileged to have a decent full-time remote job with decent benefits, a house, a spouse, and a kid who is doing well in school. But it is all a facade. An illusion. On the inside, I am a complete wreck and have been for a long time. I have 0 friends, literally 0. I am not close to anyone in my family and have no real support system other than myself. And I have had a series of events unfold in the last couple of months that have put me over the edge.

1) My spouse announced that she was unhappy in the marriage and has been for years and wants to separate and possibly divorce. She does not want to try any counseling. We have had some struggles over the past few years, but this shocked me to the core. I had no idea that she was so unhappy with me and had been for so long. It seems that I was completely oblivious to an entire layer and series of indirect communication about her unhappiness.

2) Up until now, my work has largely been tasks that I could do on my own with minimal social interaction beyond email, messaging, or the occasional off-camera virtual meeting. I had a routine that I followed every day. This worked very well for me, as I have always struggled with social interaction and chaotic work environments. Now, my job is evolving to require more on-camera virtual meetings that I will need to lead, more on-camera coordination and interaction with larger groups of people, more randomly scheduled sporadic (and pointless) virtual meetings, and fewer of the independent tasks that I prefer and enjoy doing.

3) Even though many of my colleagues scattered around the country (US) have worked successfully in full-time remote positions for years, my employer has joined the ""Return to Office"" bandwagon to improve ""collaboration"" and ""culture"" and is mandating that all employees come into the nearest office soon. Two-hour commute for me each way to a building in a notoriously bad and dangerous area with an open floorplan, exceedingly bright lights, and very poor noise abatement. All to ""collaborate"" with my colleagues (none in my location) via Zoom/Teams.

4) My whole life, I have had an intense interest in numbers. As a kid, I used to spend hours at the library poring over population statistics, sports statistics, any statistics I could get my hands on. Numbers make sense to me. They are unambiguous. They have clear rules. There are no hidden meanings or ""reading between the lines"" or emotional component. They do not require social interaction. The number is the number. 

I have also had an intense interest in technology, particularly computers. I remember spending hours on Usenet and using NCSA Mosaic (showing my age here) to explore the Internet. In high school and college, my free time was spent in computer labs. As I got older, I started to collect older computers and loved to spend time tinkering and repairing them and creating elaborate spreadsheets detailing all the technical specifications. And that became my passion and my escape and the one place where I could experience some degree of joy. I started buying older computers to work on. I had it in my head that I would eventually repair and resell some of them and hold on to some of the more vintage ones for a longer term and resell them for a profit. And then I bought more. And more. And I would dutifully record the technical specifications in my spreadsheet. And then rinse and repeat. It reached the point where I had the large part of a room filled with computers. They were all neatly organized and cataloged. But there were a lot. As I look it at now objectively, I realize that I went overboard and that I spent far too much money on it. 

The thing is is that I never really noticed the spending on computers. As the numbers guy, I have been the one to handle all the finances in our household since the beginning. But I did not track our spending at that level of detail. Every month, we were maxing out our retirement savings, paying our mortgage (including an extra principal payment to pay it off faster), paying all our bills, paying our credit card balances in full, and not incurring any new debt. We had money for travel and for emergencies. Our net worth kept increasing year to year. It looked like we were doing fine. But without the spending on computers, we would have been saving a lot more. 
I have been going through the transactions over the last few years and am recording all the spending on computers, and it has made me sick to my stomach. I do not have a final amount, but it will be a lot. And I feel like a complete idiot and total failure for all the spending that I did. And I know that once I have a final figure and share it with my spouse, she will likely be livid and the already remote chance of salvaging our seemingly doomed marriage will be obliterated.

So as I write this, I am feeling completely despondent, humiliated, and am in a really dark place. I have failed everyone and can't see anything to look forward to. I have even had fleeting thoughts of travelling all the way out to San Francisco to pay a visit to the Golden Gate Bridge, but now that they have implemented 2-Step verification (deterrent net), that option is less viable. Sorry, a feeble attempt at some gallows humor. I am safe.

442,Has anyone else experienced this?,"This is hard to explain... but basically I developed anxiety and depression for no reason when I was 11. And yes, seemingly no reason genuinely. Not a reason that's not good enough or repressed memories, ACTUALLY no reason. I used to be energetic, social, and happy before that. It literally came out of nowhere when nothing could have triggered; nothing changed. Besides that, I know it isn't a brilliant way to cope but sometimes I browse depression memes that give certain incentives like ""I had my pain behind a smile every day"" and ""I only live as to not hurt my friends or family""... which I don't relate to at all. But the main point of this post is this: I've been depressed for almost 9 years and I never tried to get better or fight it. People say they've tried coping, yet I never did and went to sewerslide. Even at the start of it, I just immediantly went to that. I didn't listen to therapy, meds didn't seem to help (okay that may not have been my fault but still). I didn't want an alternative solution, I had no aspirations besides death, and... well, yeah. I wish I understood what made me so utterly hopeless at such a young age and so adamant on it without any willingness to cope better.

445,I (25F) have lived with depression and trauma my whole life. Can I get better?,"Hi, I'm looking for advice/success stories/whatever help you can provide to someone in my situation.

For as long as I can remember, I have lived with severe mental health issues. There is a lot of childhood trauma (diagnosed as C-PTSD), I'm autistic and have been going through periods of depression since my early teens. I probably have undiagnosed ADHD but with the waiting lists where I live at, that's going to be undiagnosed for a long time.

I struggle with: Having no friends, no romantic relationships, no positive relationships with my family, my flat being messy, feeling worthless, poor physical health, looking average on my best days, little success at work, going back to uni at 23 and not finishing my degree before the age of 27 (if I even manage to finish it), living from paycheck to paycheck. There isn't much going well for me but there are some things: I have an affordable flat, I am somehow employable and able to work at least part-time, I am unable to deal with ""normal"" social situations but do have strategies to manage the usual workplace interactions.

The main issue I have is: I've never experienced anything different. I don't know what living without depression and other mental health issues feels like. For me personally, I don't feel like I'm living \*with\* a mental health problem. The mental health problem feels like a part of me, like a personality trait or something. But I don't want to - I can't - spend another 60 or something years like this.  
The last two years, I actively looked for professional help, so far with little success. I can't afford therapy for more than two sessions a month and all of the anti-depressants I've tried (now five in total) have either made my depression worse or they had severe side effects. I'm open to trying new medications and strategies but there is little specialised psychiatric care for neurodivergent people especially when I can't afford private care. So maybe this won't be a hit.

I'm since a few months at a place in my life where I feel completely hopeless and as if there is no chance for me to live a fulfilling life. I see two options now: Kill myself or somehow find a way to heal/find meaning/reduce pain. I'm not expecting to become a happy person or some kind of a high achiever. But I'd like my quality of life to become better. As I'm in my mid-twenties this feels kind of impossible, I often read about my brain now being made of cement by now but I want to try whatever before giving up because a part of me still wants to get better.",1b31203,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b31203/i_25f_have_lived_with_depression_and_trauma_my/

448,My decent into self hatred and recognizing mental disorders: 'THE mask we wear.',"First off, I'm not suicidal*. 

I used to attempt suicide in many ways and after my 16th attempt (2020) I realized self preservation wants me to survive against my own will, possibly due to a unrealistic superego. Every attempt failed and honestly baffles me I'm physically unharmed after alcoholism, drugs, dithenhydramine abuse, but while it should be praised I beat every addiction cold turkey just further pisses me off.

My depression peaked  in 2021 when a family member was abusing his daughters, and when confronted,  blamed me. Thankfully that coward killed himself,  but made me realize with the fbi, distrust and that he abandoned his kids  , fled to Oklahoma and killed himself going 113mph into a building. Before that, I was constantly attacked, defamed and treated like a monster. I still don't know why they blamed me, but after the fact, the fbi contacted me, returned my belongings and instead of a apology,  was told because I didn't kill myself,  I wasn't the suspect? My reputation was ruined and caused discontent in my household.  

The fact the fbi treated me like a monster broke something in me mentally and basically left me comatose in bed for 2 years. Before all that, he was honestly really nice and inviting.  I'm more pissed no one defended me and no one denied the possibility,  the family moved away after his death but refuses to contact me or apologize. 

Now, add everything else, being a army vet with ptsd and jobless for 10 years. This caused another issue. My self confidence was destroyed.  I basically became a inactive and unmotivated shell and honestly I blame myself for not being more confident and fearing the worst; so don't see a incentive to try. I chalked it down as me being weak and not seeing the point in self happiness. 

Back in 2023, I realized my behavior changed and noticed manic episodes I saw as me being excited and happy to engage with others, to being extremely depressed and basically becoming a jackass to myself, stating I don't deserve to be happy as no one gives a crap about personal struggles. I realized I was showing textbook examples of manic depression and ptsd from the 2 years I was locked in my room. 

I learned how my brain works by having people point out my maniac episodes.  The first major depression episode was staying up for 7 days and I didn't think I deserved to rest.  The 2nd episodes resulted in me going on crusades and mass reporting pedophiles to the point my friends begged me to stop; I assume due to my experience with those cockroaches, I felt personally attacked and went on what my friends call 'doing a batman.' My family had to basically get rid of my internet and was told by people I was doing nothing if not destroying myself in a fruitless crusade.  When I finally stopped, I was so defeated I planned to run away and never return. Thankfully my friends noticed the essessive anger i felt and told me to stop for my sanity.

Last manic episodes started appearing in 4-72 hours bursts of confidence,  only to utterly destroy me mentally and emotionally.   They seem to be getting worse and I started showing OCD with grooming,  hair plucking and staring into space for hours at a time.  It honestly scares me when I go manic as I have no short-term memories and started having worrying  symptoms of dementia and memory of things 5-30 seconds before slipping my mind or basically going autopilot with my actions.  I greatly blame my abuse of antihistamines,  as dith basically disables parts of your brain in massive dosages. (Went from 200mgs for sleep to 900mgs in a week.) I noticed the issues and believe it's drug induced psychosis.  I can quit, but since the army and 2020 It became my way to 'turning off' my brain so I didn't go full manic and get rest. It's a issue but making efforts to quit( the recreational use isn't the goal, I just want to be out cold so I can stop thinking for once


My main desire is to find a job, but with no work experience,  my manic episodes being very obvious,  and lack of confidence and self respect,  I never even get a callback interview. The other is more existenalism and my inner monolog being able to make me unaware of who I am anymore.  A job I was interviewed for a week ago basically told me I lacked confidence in general and didn't seem to have a drive to be happy.  All I could do was agree and left; breaking down in my car until I went home. 

I am an veteran,  but don't have the confidence in it actually helping as when I went to a VA therapist in the military (Osan AFB) I realized they were not wanting to help me, but told me I was a threat to others, highly intelligent (I'm not.) And I'd never change due to not having trust in the people I work for.( it was hell as almost everyone was sociopathic or grew numb and callus. ) I also had a alcohol problem that basically resulted in me being kicked out for alcoholism and depression.  My alcoholism was soo bad, I would carry soju (60%) in my canteen. Not proud, but honestly would be dead without it att. The last thing I asked my platoon sgt when I got on my plane was,
""Was I at least a good soldier?"" Followed by him commanding me to get on and don't look back. That always hurt me as I was a star soldier and battle buddy to everyone. I was blindsided by the discontent he showed,  as if anger.

Sorry, probably manic atm.

My issue is I honestly Hate myself,  don't know who I am anymore (as a person), and realized I never had friends,  but people who used me and my family,  using me as a scapegoat.  I have hobbies and even a indie game developer (self taught) but only did it so I could have a mark left on the world before I killed myself *(past tense).
I ended up getting a sizable community,  but the pressure for perfection and it going unrewarded or recognized outside it being a passion project it was not beneficial to me who is basically homeless and has no income. I feel like I can't do anything worth a job,  have stills that don't translate to civilian work and basically treated like I don't  even want a job or some work comp scammer.

I have no self respect and noticed my mental issues are gradually getting worse. I have a supportive mom, but my father,  my siblings and inlaws basically treat me like I'm sociopathic, makes excuses and use my parents for free boarding. It sucks being 33yo without a job. It really,  really sucks and honestly makes me shut down mentally while I just 'go thru the motions of existing. '

I don't have insurance,  money,  support or a therapist as no job = no money. My father treats me like a disappointment,  never let's me talk and actively makes it obvious he doesn't want his son around ( he thinks I purposely got out-of the military,  and doesn't believe anything I tell him. )

I just wanted to vent, I'm tired of my manic depression and with the dementia symptoms I basically have a identity crisis and basically blame myself for not being a normal adult with a life.

Thanks for letting me vent. Hope you guys feel better,  as you still can make a change.

449,Am I making a mistake or is it just a phase?,"In 4 days I will move to a new place for my studies. I am gonna be in a completely new environment.  New people, new everything. This is not something that I haven't done before. I have. But something or someone inside keeps telling me I am making a huge mistake and I will be miserable there. Desperate to be clear.

I have OCD—a mild one. I have taken meds for neurological issues before. I have to repeat the treatment once in a year. Death is always on my mind. The only reason death is just a thought, not an appealing action to be taken because of my sister. We have already lost our mother tragically and I don't want her to suffer more. I don't. Are these issues the reason for my current mental state? idk.

She is really supportive of this decision. She has friends, a boyfriend and a career. I have almost nothing. All of my friends are elsewhere. I have been living abroad since I was 17. Normally, I should be feeling normal. But I don't. I don't know what's wrong with me. Starting over is never easy, I know that but I also should feel okay about it. 

Am I a drama queen? Or a bad person who is not grateful or my inner voice is telling me the most important advice of my life?

451,maintaining friendships is so hard,"someone recently told me that i am ungrateful and entitled to the kindness people give to me. and they werent wrong, i hate that the most about myself. they said i always focus on the negative and that i cant step back to appreciate the good that people bring into my life.

and i know their criticisms are fair. it fucking sucks being friends with someone who seems to always be in their head and always looking on the downside of things. and it just sucks bc i cant help it. at all. im sure a normal person would be able to appreciate the good things in their life and to take the time to give back to those who give to you, but im not normal. i get stuck on my past and i talk myself down. i cant thank bc it just comes out as guilt bc i dont deserve it at all. 

but how do u even explain that without it just sounding like some excuse to dismiss my own behavior. like trust me.. i know how horrible of a person i am. i am the person who hates myself the most after all. 

idk its just hard having to navigate the negativity that i innately live in while still trying to appreciate ~the little things~ in life. i know being friends with someone who is just chronically sad isnt easy. and i cant expect people to understand me bc its very irrational. but … for things that come easy to people, its just such an obstacle for me.

I am terrified I will lose my job any minute. I got written up recently and told next time is a final warning or termination. I made a mistake this week and have a meeting with my managers tomorrow. I have been panicking all week. Can’t eat. Basically folding into myself.

I try hard to do a good job but I do get distracted easily and I get bored easily. My mind never shuts off. 

I make a decent lower middle class salary for my area and the job is only a few minutes from me. So I’m comfortable in my setting. I’m also in a somewhat rural area so there isn’t much else job wise unless I go into the cities.

I basically send my therapist a plea for help as I don’t know what to do. Just the thought of being let go and having to start all over (after 6 years) terrifies me. My jaw clenches shut and I start freezing.

It’s very hard for me to express verbally how I feel either I can’t get it out or I just completely break down.

Idk why things for people like me just can be easy. It’s harder.

I wish I knew someone who I could go work for without losing much in regards to salary and d benefits.

I wish I could maybe go on disability and just enjoy the rest of my life , I’m 41 next week. But I think it pays horribly and my wife doesn’t make enough to keep us afloat.

I do think about suicide. I can’t do it. It’s a fear I have of death since I was a child. I think I have trauma. I know I have sexual abuse trauma for sure which hasn’t helped me in life.

456,How to beat depression fatigue and brain fog,"Hello all !

I've had depression for a while now (officially diagnosed) and i take meds for it. It really helped with unwanted thoughts and spiraling but there's one thing it didn't help with and it's kinda hard to live with that : fatigue and brain fog. Even tho i'm often in a neutral or good mood, I'm constantly SO exhausted, i often have to fight to stay awake at work and when i'm on a day off i can have a full 8h night, take two 3 or 4h nap in the day then have a full 8h night again. Sleeping is actually almost my only activity on the weekends and it's really depressing cause i wanna do stuff but im just so tired. With that there is big brain fog most of the time.
I was wondering if any of y'all had any advice on that ? We ruled out physical causes with my GP (blood tests, IRM, scanner... we did all lmao).
How do you deal with being tired, i just don't want to be sleepy all the time anymore. Energy drinks help a bit but it's so bad for health i don't want to rely on that.

457,Why does a series of bad events whenever I’m trying so hard to get ahead in life? Feeling so down,"So it all started when I wanted to upgrade my house last year. We live in a very small house with mold issues. Honestly I have been sad and embarrassed about the condition of our house. Spoke to my husband about potentially selling to upgrade to a bigger house. He told me we won’t be able to afford it with 1 income (his) and my part time job. So determined to achieve this goal, I went to look for full time work. After 2 months, I landed a full time job. 2 weeks in I founded the job extremely hard. Commute 2-3 hours daily really took a toll on me. Not long after getting the job, I had to bring my son a long to work and on my way to work a seat belt camera took a photo of my son not wearing his seatbelt properly. 4 demerit points and $1161. Still determined to not give up, kept going and ended up finding a house we like. After losing out on the offer, agent called to say the other pulled out and it’s ours. During the build and inspection we found out that original buyer pullled out because the house has so many things wrong with it. This prompted us to pulled out. So disappointed, we kept looking and losing out on another house. Decided we are just going to knock down rebuild now. After months of being excited and 1 week before signing contract, just found out today that my husband lost his job. Is this the universe trying to prevent me to get a house? Why is it when I try so hard to better myself, a million things go wrong? It’s making me so depressed. I just wanted to vent and if anyone has any similar story that has a valuable lesson.

Before any of this happened, I was dealing with family issues.

I started smoking vapes at the age of 12. It then evolved into smoking cigarettes. After, I have smoked cigarettes for a total of 1 yr.

472,Kinda wanna just end it all,"Maybe I’m just seeking stupid but I’ve been having really heavy episodes of depression. Especially with relationships and friendships. Like friends have made it aren’t I might be the only one considering them actual friends. I’m always the one reaching out, sending videos, making conversation. If I don’t text, they don’t text me. The conversations I have to almost fight to make them work. And it’s been hitting me really hard so usually I have to hold on to things to hope on, like my favorite food, a new tv show, and such.
Like yesterday, I don’t usually get money (I can’t find a job for the life of me) so when my friend was going to finally pay me back $12 I was glad because I could finally get myself a treat or something and they accidentally sent it to the wrong person and wasn’t able to get it back. It kind of felt like a snapping point, like being on a tightrope and it just snaps and I feel back into this huge wave of depression. I’m tired of feeling like this. I’m sorry this is very long but it feels like nothing is going right. It’s been a countless loop. I want to stop the loop but don’t know how. I’m constantly stressing with college work, barely able to enjoy things, financial worries, and more.

473,I hadn’t heard from my BF in 4 days and his location went dark. Is my BF depressed or is he trying to walk away?,"Some background. One year relationship (M 22) hadn’t heard from my bf (M 26) in almost 4 days and his location turned off 2 days into that.
It shut off right after he got home from work, that was the last ping it sent. We mainly just keep location on for emergencies (I have bad luck with car problems) and they've stayed on in the background for a year now.
Our last contact was over the weekend, and he did seem a tad distant. I had brought up how lately its felt like he doesn't really want or reciprocated my affection attempts over text. The last thing I heard from him before the radio silence was ""I'm sorry you feel that way I wish I could be better for you.""

On day 4 I was advised to reach out and check in on his safety, I sent a message and called a few times. Finally I got this text response: ""Sorry I have been rethinking my life lately and just been really depressed hence the withdrawal from everyone.""

I have seen him struggle with PTSD and thoughts of suicide in the past, and I’m just having a hard time gauging what to do in this situation and following that message. 

People who have experience with depression or have dated someone with depression, what are your thoughts? Has a partner ever said anything similar and what did you do?

i never knew i could be so easily tired this early in the day. i constantly feel like giving up on daily tasks and mentally abandoning things halfway because i struggle with sustaining attention and coming up with responses as well.

im unable to stay up past 10pm. i cant really go out with friends in the evening. I cant sleep over at my partner's place. i never even tried nightlife, and now i will never know what that is.

as a man, i am so ashamed and defeated that i am mentally and physically weak. and to be honest, i am a trans man. i have enough people doubting and refusing to acknowledge and affirm me, and now this is just more reasons for me to justify why i deserve how people treat me.

i know i am not alone, but oh, this is such a overwhelming sense of sadness, inferiority and defeat. I feel powerless.

i am currently on a 1.5h commute home at 10pm. reaching home would be such an achievement, but i wont feel any sense of accomplishment.

I don't know maybe I maybe a people pleaser and also very ambitious but the thing is I'm only human and I can't do it all I'm still learning and right now I feel very stuck. I also feel like when theres a problem I'm the blame since Im really really ambitious and very naive as well consequently I feel like I have the burden of keepingeveryone around me happy and put the world in my shoulder. Also I'm very emotional which adds to all the problems I already have bcos I make the problem worse instead of doing anything I dread doing anything which altogether isn't  good combinations. Right now I just finished crying becos my sister brought in a stray cat they were maybe less than a month old and they make me leave it elsewhere after just a day the kittens are with us.  And I ponder about this and thought if my sister didn't pick it up and bring home there could be a much better home for them. A home where they weren't thrown out just again and in the cold breeze of the night.

I have severe untreated depression and attempted suicide twice 2 weeks ago. My mother beat my ass and threw me across the living room after witnessing my second attempt not too long ago. She told me that the suicide, if it was successful, would have benefitted her and my dad. And insulted me with the most hurtful words you can imagine and make fun of my depression.  
  
My parents are abusive( mostly psychologically abusive but my mom gets physical with me even if i havent done anything wrong) narcissistic, over controlling, give me academic pressure, unloving, incredibly sexist and hyper religious to the point i cant do anything fun and even drive as i turned an adult last year, dress like i want or go outside my house. They gave me trauma twice along with religious trauma, with a really horrible incident that has scar me for life, that led me to attempt suicide thrice(counting last year)  
  
I have no one else to support me, no adult, teacher, school counselor or relative i can trust. I have no friends. I begged my mother to get some psychiatric help but she refused and threatened me to go a religious school( not comfortable on revealing my religion) as she thinks faith is the answer to my problems. Screw that, if it was helpful, how comes i didnt get better from it.  
  
The only way to get therapy is to wait till i get independent from my family which is incredibly hard even if i graduate a levels next year, my mother will stick with me while im in uni.  
  
My depression is getting worse and worse and i havent touched a book for the past 2 months and i have a huge exam. Please, encourage me to study. I cant go to a hospital in any way as im even more restricted to go outside after my attempts.

481,I have lost the will to continue,"I don’t want to bring up my whole story here as it’s way too much. The main reason for my depression is that I became disabled a few years ago. It’s not the only reason though. The last years consisted of a lot brutal stuff and it was always the same routine: I experienced something deeply hurtful, fell into a hole and pulled myself out of it one or two days later and continued.

After I invested great hope in something important and got disappointed for the millionth time, something changed within my mind. It was like four days ago. Since these four days I’ll only leave my bed for going to the bathroom. I barely ate. I can’t pull myself out of this hole this time. It’s like I‘m emotionally completely numb while there is this feeling of pure hopelessness and my conviction that it’s never getting better. That it would be the best if I‘m dead. I never had that before. The pure thought of having to continue with my shite life is just unbearable.

Is this something that might resolve on its own? I definitely don’t want to go to some kind of mental hospital or talk to a psychiatrist. ",1b2zq7s,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2zq7s/i_have_lost_the_will_to_continue/

I had insomnia before taking sertraline and the anxiety and depression was making it worse. After 6 or so months I moved to mirtazipine for a year and a half. I had alot of unresolved issues from my teens and adulthood plus with my mum dying 5 years ago I fell into a deep depression and anxiety that I just buried. decided to get some help cause I was fed up feeling like crap 24/7. did some CBT therapy but I never found it helpful if anything it made me feel worse. came off my ssri before Christmas after titrating down cause it muted everything and if anything I was getting more depressed. drs didn't know I was getting more depressed but I didn't feel the meds I was taking were the answer after taking them for so long. anyways after coming off them I felt great up until about 2 weeks ago. bam I wake up one morning and something switched in my head and I now feel hopeless and lost and feel like I'm in a massive hole I can't get out of, haven't slept in about 3/4 days and sleep in general has been poor when I do sleep. nothing has happened to me personally since coming off the ssri to make me feel this way so I don't understand why I'm feeling like this. it's a feeling I can't shake no matter what I'm trying to do. I keep fit go to the gym regularly and play sports, don't drink often (only at Christmas, family events and my birthday). even then it's never more than a few pints. I don't take drugs either. anyways that's my story. if I contact my local Dr how likely do you think it is they will put me on ssri again and make me see CBT guy? the thought is making me more anxious.

Not my first but the first and only I really cared about (I'm almost 30). Everything with him felt new and exciting so I guess the hormones associated with what people call love (which I didn't believe in) made me happy for the first time in my life. It's not like I was stupid enough to think that my depression was magically cured, but deep down I wished for it. At the same time I dreaded it coming back full force every day and that's what happened last week. I tried to deal with it on my own like I always did, the sleepness nights, the existential dread and panic attacks at night and the compulsive thoughts to jump from every bridge and in front of every car. But yesterday, on his birthday, I couldn't contain it. I suddenly got scared looking at him. Of the inavoidable future and the burden I would be on him. And I showed it by being an asshole and at the end of our fight just running home where I sent him an accusatory message about breaking up. I hate myself, I ruined not only his birthday but also the celebration of him finding a new job. He was my last chance. That's what I told myself at the beginnend of our relationship. I can't do this anymore and I can't do this to anymore anymore. I feel incredibly manipulative for basically forcing him to have a talk this weekend by just appearing at his doorstep in teams. But at the same time I break down every time I think about him not being in my life. But it is not fair of me to make him stay in a relationship with me. It's just so hard. Nobody, not even my family, has ever even liked me and I don't care for anyone but him. If I lose him, I don't think I can recover from it. For the first time I had something to look forward to but I ruined it by questioning his feelings for me and projecting that fear on him. Now I'm lying here wondering how I'm supposed to endure this pain. It's even worse than before meeting him or at least it feels like it because I haven't felt it in a while.

490,I can’t even stand looking at a piano.,"I’ve been playing piano since 6. It was a pretty early start and I’ve gained recognition for my fast progress. I’ve been to some contests and got awards, and tried to pass levels. Even though I never took piano seriously, and only practiced an average of 30-40 minutes a day, I was still learning something new everyday. It was still something I was good at, something I was partially proud of. Later after I was introduced to RCM, I started taking a different path, some of my progress before was lost, and I realized there is so much areas I needed improving on. I went to lessons regularly, although progress wasn’t as fast, I was still practicing regularly and I was able to play pieces I liked. When I was around 11. I passed my RCM level 8 practical and theory exam. Preparing for the exams had been most efficient in improving my skills. Later I was learning level 9, and I had switched my teacher. This new teacher made me nervous for every lesson, and I was dreading it every two days before class. However my skills were improving greatly so I guess there is nothing to complain about. But things escalated and I started getting anxiety before every class and it made my stomach sick. It was then I decided to switch back to my old teacher and continue on with where I left off. My progress slowed once again and I didn’t do any exams at the time. When I was 12 I started level 9 history, and I was one hell of a procrastinator. I spent a whole year but only studied effectively in the last month before the deadline, even though I got a pretty good mark, it definitely took too long to complete, and I was not proud at all. That was what made me realize how much faster others have finished theirs and moving on, while I wasted a whole year? Soon after I started harmony 9, I know I shouldn’t even be complaining because how easy it was for the people that studied along with me. Yes, I joined an online group taught by a different teacher. That was the absolute worst part about learning music. When everyone else seems to get everything while your own brain is completely fried. When the teacher finished most of the lessons she said I needed extra help. Which just makes me feel like an outcast. I was in the middle of doing those catch-up lessons when I, out of nothing in this world, told my parents I didn’t want to continue learning piano anymore. And if you have read to the very end I want to thank you for taking the time to do so, and I want to share the fact that, things went downhill so quick after I decided to give up. I never finished harmony 9, and it makes me feel like a failure. I did started to play level 10 before, but never took the exam. Now I’m 14 and I feel like I was worse than I was 2 years ago, because I’m cowardly enough, that I can’t even look at a piano anymore. So I never proved myself to be worthy of having lessons again. And every night I just think about the fact that I wasted so much time and money, but all I did was give up? I tried and tried to play my favourite pieces, but I would get so frustrated because of my declining skills and feel absolutely worthless. I feel like everyone else is moving on, passing exams after exams, while I keep retreating, back to the place where I started.",1b2vkhi,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2vkhi/i_cant_even_stand_looking_at_a_piano/

499,Are people with severe depression responsible for their behavior/action?,"Everyone has their own unique set of beliefs. I understand that this forum will get a lot of dislikes due to the controversy. For me personally, I always felt like my MDD was controlling me as if I was a puppet rather than me controlling myself. The small percent of control I had was to seek help (belittled by therapist and denied proper diagnosis). I wasn't diagnosed until I ended up in the hospital. This doesn't mean I'm answering my own question on whether I'm responsible or not. I just want insight on other people's opinions to create my own conclusions.  
Obviously, the people hurt by poor behavior don't deserve that treatment. Some people may challenge this belief by saying that it's okay if they hurt you, but ""revenge is never the answer.""

I had a father with severe anxiety so bad he went to the hospital several times a year. After half a life span of battling anxiety, he had finally found his way of coping. Seeing the drastic change, I really questioned myself. I have forgiven him whole heartedly despite all the pain, but he still caused me all that trauma. Yet, I don't blame him for it. I don't hold him accountable either. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, beliefs, etc. My experience most likely isn't the same for everyone.",1b2n3so,9,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2n3so/are_people_with_severe_depression_responsible_for/

My grandma just died I should be crying and grieving. I never understood why I could never feel or show emotion I hated my life I hated everything about it.

Normal without her in my life. I felt as if everyday there was new lesson on why shouldn’t be here. When she passed away I grew up. I started hating life even more I hated my body, my face, my brain everything that exist about me. Life wasn’t enjoyable no more, because when you hate your body it’s hard to enjoy the rest.

the way i function now is no better if not worse than how i was at 15. 

i work part time(i don’t bother working any extra shifts) , i am only capable of taking 2 classes at a time at my community college(me transferring to university is nowhere in sight), i don’t have my license or permit(i live in socal), i don’t pay bills, i’m in credit card debt, i go along with anything that my friends want to do even if i hate it. this is just the tip of the iceberg 

i have tried therapy on and off last year and i just ghosted my most recent therapist because i was always late to appointments or would just forget about it so i got too embarrassed to keep seeing her, i told myself i’d work harder at trying to get better this year but i feel incapable but i still haven’t tried looking for another therapist— i also have been prescribed medication but i am bad at taking them as well so idk if it’s just not working or i haven’t been consistent enough with it.

503,"No longer looking for ""better""... I will just exist until I can erase myself completely. I'm disappearing in every way I know how. ","I'm so exhausted of enduring and having to be positive in the face of it all to essentially ease the discomfort of others. So I have decided to do the bare minimum to get by, to survive without expectations or hopes. I will embrace the Numb. If I'm not allowed to kill myself (the recent attempt failed and traumatized my family and friends), and I'll never escape this cycle of poverty, I'll just exist as little as possible. Maybe then it won't hurt so much. Living that is. I'll work three jobs again if needed, go home, sleep, and repeat every day until I am granted the grace to die.

I want to start fresh though. Move to a new state, change my name and number, delete my socials, and be as nonexistent as possible. I don't want to be known anymore, not in this version of me. I want to be erased. I don't care about making new friends or dating. I won't even worry about getting a job with health insurance. Let nature take its course, because what's the point of trying to keep this body barely alive. Even if I lose the ability to walk because of my condition. I'll crawl to my grave if I have to. 

I'm beyond broke and struggling to find jobs. But if I can get one soon, I'll spend the next three months saving to move. I don't care what state, just something affordable. I considered a storage unit since I may only be able to afford to live in a car or motel, or I can just sell everything I own because what's the point of keeping it. 

Today I applied for the name change, which I'll keep a secret. When I leave, I won't tell anyone, just pack and go. No more drowning and pretending I'm okay because of my love for others. No more daydreaming about the future or imagining that things will change. I'm 30; I know better. I don't know why it took me so long to accept my reality, but maybe now the pain won't be so deep.

505,Chapter 1 my life,"I moved from Virginia when I was 6 to California. The kids didn’t like me from the start. The only kid I connected with was in 3rd grade, named Mo. This friendship lasted until the summer, going into 6th grade. Where it all started, me and Mo started talking. We had the same taste in music, and we thought we were so mature. The first time I did something illegal was when we went around our school after hours and searched the trash cans for liquor. We found some, put it in a bottle, and drank it. It was disgusting. Right after that, well, it only got worse. The first time I got my hands on a vape was when I stole it from my friend's mom (who later found out).
And we and Mo burned that shit out in two days flat. Remember, I was in 5th grade. We looked through his dad's part of the house and found a lighter and a box of cigarettes. We smoked them, laughed, and rapped some songs I came up with. Man, I was a dumbass kid. We smoked every day on anything we could get ahold of, and Mo even got a girl friend. We did this until he bought two vapes off of a kid at our school one week before his birthday and birthday plans. 3 days before his birthday, his mom finds them, and he’s grounded for 3 months. One month after he was ungrounded, he found out that he was moving five hours away. We hung out one last time, and he’s texted all of my friends and his ex-girlfriend but not me. Not one goddamn text call or email. Not shit. It makes you want to die inside.

I try to be there for my friends and family with their mental struggles but it feels like they don't reciprocate.

I know people will suggest therapy but I don't have the time or resources for it to be consistent. I need a better job with better healthcare but it's hard to do with limited skills and time.

519,I don’t care about myself. At all.,"So, I have been perpetually depressed for over 2 years now. I believe I know what snowballed it. The summer after I graduated high school, I was very happy. I had a lot of friends, I went outside, I ran and lifted weights, etc. 

I knew this was gonna end, however. I had to move, and everyone’s off to college now. I was still around (kinda), but I didn’t have my own car at the time, so I didn’t really have the freedom of going wherever I wanted. Eventually, I’m not hanging out with people as much, and not making any new friends. It was my first winter break where it hit me: I realized, “wait, I don’t actually think I’m truly enjoying anything”

Fast forward to my sophomore year of college. I had no clue what I wanted to major in, skipped classes all the time, no friends, no consistent habits, etc. I’d have phases of going to the gym regularly, eating well, even looking better and more in-shape, but I never ended up keeping up those habits. Because I never ended up CARING. About ANYTHING.

So, here’s the present: To run things down, I’m unfortunately smart enough where most of the time, I don’t try in my classes, but I get away with passing them. I have made zero friends in the past 3 years, I am not much bigger or stronger than I was that summer after high school, and I still don’t care about anything (obviously).

This semester, I actually have gotten better with keeping up with homework and such. Except for one class. I have a midterm tomorrow (well technically today), and I have had ALL DAY to prepare for it. But I end up doing NOTHING. I have shot myself in the fucking foot. Do I care? Do I not care? Am I fucking bipolar? WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?????? I’m gonna lose my mind. One day everything’s fine and the next I self destruct and potentially set myself up for failing a class.

523,On suicide,"Just something ive been thinking about (not fleshed out yet) is we should hold on for life itself not bc of its specific meaning but bc its precious in and of itself. 

This is in context of the genocide in gaza. If i were there i couldnt imagine being able to bear the tiniest amount of that level of trauma and loss. Id lose it. But theyre holding on and i cant imagine why but they are. Their very existence is meaningful not at all what they do. I also have never been religious or spiritual but their conviction is making me lean towards that way. If they can still affirm life, faith, love then i could too.

So even if i dont want my life or cant beat it or literally cannot move to do anything i should still exist and be of service to others. If i give away my life then at least its for someone and something. I realize im not writing this at my worst and im in a relatively ok headspace so idk if i can commit to thinking this way when the depression kills me slowly (and ofc i do realize its an illness i take meds and did ect and tms so not minimizing at all i know its debilitating). So maybe whenever we think of suicide we affirm life instead and thats what keeps us going. (Just reflecting on how can someone still have the will to resist given the circumstances).

i just cant open up to anyone about how much i am in a struggle with myself. i hate myself so much and am just burnt out at this point by just being in my own skin. when im with my family, im trying to keep up, but i barely feel anything. when im out with friends, i barely feel anything. i feel awful and drained and just want to rot

I've cut myself, hit myself, I've gotten excessively drunk, I've starved myself, I've overeaten myself. I've slept away months and forced myself to stay awake for days on end. All trying to cope.

I have no idea where this supposed to go. How many more years am I supposed to waste away like this? I've had no childhood, my father wasn't there often enough and my mother had nothing in her mind other than herself. My teenage years are full of above mentioned coping, in combination with ruthless bullying and a family falling apart. I've been assaulted several times. I always end up with the same people. I've got no one around me anymore. I have given away everything I had hoping what I was giving it away for was getting better. But it never did.

I don't see how I'm supposed to ever live. I have never learned what security is. I've never learned what true love is. I've never learned what stability is. All I know is that no one is there for me. That everyone hates me. My entire life was just me trying to survive. And I hate that i survived. I have no more patience, no more hope. I cannot see how I'm supposed to learn to feel emotions that aren't anger, frustration or sadness. How I'm supposed to not be afraid of everything and everyone. How to not hate myself for every single thing. How to not feel watched by everyone, ready to criticise and make fun of me.

How could you possibly rewire my entire brain.
How could you possibly strip me of my entire personality, my entire experience, my entire life.",1b2k8n0,8,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2k8n0/i_feel_like_im_too_far_gone/
527,lost my empathy,"ever since i was younger, i’ve always been a very empathetic person. i loved helping people, i loved supporting them, i loved helping them stop feeling like shit and the like. but now ever since i started to feel “depressed” (which was about 9 months ago), i stopped caring about everything, including people. my whole life i’ve genuinely wanted to help people (but not in like an over responsible or feeling obligated kind of way). now i cant even extend my empathy. i cant be bothered after my sweet, loving friend told me that shes suicidal (and even attempted once) and so on. i feel like i should do something but i dont know what that is, it came to me so much easier before, you know making people feel better but right now i dont even know what to do. i dont know the right words to say. even if i do something right now its not enough its not genuine. i cant believe i didnt notice, it was painfully obvious now that i think about it. i do not like this, at all. i do not wish to live like this. hence why i wanted to ask if any of you were or are in a similar situation, how did you get over it, how long did it take you to do so, and if you can really recover from depression, you know go back to your “normal self”. hoping for your insights :> thank you!!",1b2ticn,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2ticn/lost_my_empathy/

I got bullied for at least 2 years in my junior high school but then, I'm still able to live and not even feeling sad not even a single day, my father is not a friendly type but I understand after he lost my mother we only talk once in a month when I ask to pay for my school tuition every month.

I managed to land a contrast with another company, but that is coming to an end and I think I'll be unemployed again.  

I have no future career path. You see, I'm an ""artist"" *snorts (so pretentious what joke). I thought, I'd land an office job, work during the day, write and paint by night. But neither of my careers are going the way I want.  

Moreover, with the economy in the toilet and AI taking over, I can't find meaning in my life anymore. I can't afford to live in my city, even if I had a job that pays x4 what I make now. I'm always going to be on the chopping block at work because I'm low skilled. I'm way too old and stupid to be retrained in anything, it would take too long to get a degree. I don't have an interested in any field. I'm not a people person.  

My only saving grace here, is that I have no serious debt (just a car, which I could sell if I had to), no gf or kids. I can go anywhere, but I have no where to go...

533,Just a lot on my mind ,"It's been a rough couple of weeks so far I'm not gonna lie, not enough to push me to the brink of any suicidal thoughts but enough to just ruin all my ambitions and motivation in life. I'm only 21 and at this very moment I just feel like I'm going through so many different types of grief it feels like it's too much to bear. To start off my last grandparent from both sides of the family was finally put to rest after battling cancer for years just two days ago and of course the whole family was and is still pretty distraught, I've already made amends on the situation so it's not something that keeps me up at night but In the back of my mind I feel like I'm still coping at the fact my last grandparent just died which'll probably turn me into an emotional mess some point soon. The other problem I'm feeling is more or less just something that people my age usually go through which is falling in love, and right now I say it's a problem because we're so far away from each other so whenever we're apart It's like a withdrawal you can say, we're pretty new into the relationship (3 going on 4 months) which is why I feel this way right now but it just breaks my heart in a new way I can't really understand yet. This is my first moment experiencing ""young love"" and it hurts man, I'm sure I'll get better at this with time. And lastly financial troubles, for the last 3 years I've been investing in my dad's construction for his latest house he's bought with the deal being 'When this house is sold I'll either give every penny back or we can use the money you handed me for a new car'. Honestly I really need the car since I work 40 minutes from my job so I went with that but this whole process of patience is literally killing me. I've invested a little over 35k over the last 3 years by myself and Everytime I ask about the house it seems no progress has been made so I'm kinda at a loss weather I continue giving money because he's my dad or just burn the bridge and stop helping entirely and just cut my losses. 
I'm not sure what I want people to say when they read what I'm writing, I feel like I just want someone to listen. It's a lot and the only reason I'm mentioning all 3 is because they're all really happening right now at the same time. I'm sure others are dealing with alot worse so I probably sound like I'm just complaining but I just feel like writing this down helps a bit so why not post it too.

I am single and quite honestly a terrible, distant, disengaged friend, sibling and aunt.

I am afraid of myself, I’m writing and drawing a manga, I’m banking on to go big but I know for a fact it would be hard to make money off it in the competitive industry, I fear that everything I’m doing is a waste of time, I’m not gonna tell my parents about my manga because my parents are manipulative and try and change my dreams. Often times they abuse me. Verbal, mental, emotional and they take away food when I tell them how I feel about anything. I guess I’m suicidal cause I don’t care, if I don’t eat and go hungry that’s fine. If I die that’s ok. I should probably buy my own food anyways I’m an adult. My parents do want to adopt 2 boys though. From the way my parents talk and act half the reason is because I’m such a failure. I’m glad ima have 2 brothers soon, but I fear for them. Will they be subjected to the same shit I was. Probably worse because my parents would strangle someone screaming at them to breathe rather than actually let them breathe. Often times I think about jumping off high point of my university. The school of art in my university have very open spaces I can jump and die. But What happened after that? I know my friends would be pissed. The guy that “prides” himself in helping some of his friends out of suicide, dies from suicide. Talk about hypocrisy. My biggest dream is to see my mangas ending animated, but I don’t even know where to go to get the start animated. It’s a shame my life is being held together by such a childish dream. Ive never have a girl and I’m wishy washy about having one, like I just want love in bursts not constant. I’m in college and I have no idea what I want to do in life except my manga. Other than that. Nothing.  I’m literally wasting thousands of dollars. I’m late with a number of bills both my Shaw and roger bill is so late I can’t receive call anymore. I don’t have a stable job and I can’t look for an actual better one because of my classes at uni. I have faith in god but where is he now these days, I’m battling with lust obviously.

546,I can feel it closing in on me and I dont know if there's a way out of it this time.,"I've struggled with depression since my childhood.

I'm 27M, I spent most of my life on a cocktail of antidepressants.

This is the longest I've been without any. At the start of these last 4 years I stopped taking them since my life started to become the best it had ever been. Until it slowly became so much worse all over again. I was being medicated for adhd most of those 4 years. Now I stopped taking everything.

I haven't even been drinking alcohol anymore, I thought the only way out of this was clarity.  
That I needed to be completely clear in my mind. I try so hard to go to sleep early, wake up early, have consistency in my life and get my head back above the surface, but now I just lie awake all night in bed, thinking of all the things I could have done better. Every night I think about my ex. I cant help it. I'm never really asleep. Thoughts of her drift into dreams and back into conscious thoughts but im always half awake. 

I wake up crying, sometimes happy tears, but they always end sadly when I realize she isn't there. I've tried sleeping on her side of the bed, and even on the couch so that my brain doesn't trick itself into thinking that things are like they used to be. 

I'm working out, eating healthy, trying to do everything I've learnt from therapy over the years, but it's not working. I use my inhaler more often than I smoke cigarettes now and I can still barely breathe. 

I know I dug myself into a corner this time. Debt's are catching up to me, everyone in my family is going through there own hardships too.  
Throughout my life, ever since my first depressive episodes, every time I'd overcome them, I grew stronger, or so I told myself. I'd become better equipped to deal with those hardships. 

No matter how much better I got at dealing with it, even at the best of times, there was always a persistent uneasy feeling like a dark draping entity was working in the background, learning how to sabotage my progress, learning how hide seeds of chaos throughout my life so they should all flourish in crushing unison to bury me under myself when my weakest point had finally been reached.

I'm suffocating under the debris of that destruction now and I'm not strong enough to dig myself out whole this time. It's warm under here surrounded by the memories of her love, but even those memories have thorns.

548,Growing suicidal due to existential thoughts.,"It's the concept of an eternal void, and the impossibility of true nonexistence. You see, true nonexistence would imply the absence of not only everything, but everything ever. Nothing could've ever existed, and nothing has or will ever exist. The fact something exists now negates the possibility of true nonexistence. A void can, and will eventually be left in place of our current existence, and that void would be eternal.   
Throughout eternity would it not be possible, even plausible, for that void to lead to the emergence of new phenomena or realities over vast stretches of 'time'? This raises another question: Can consciousness be structured in an infinite amount of configurations? If not, it is certain that we'll be reincarnated an infinite number of times. Forced to live out an infinite amount of paradises, an infinite amount of hells, and everything in between.

549,I (20F) feel like I'm never going to be loved because of the way I look :(,"Hi! ❤️ This is my first time making a post on here so apologies if it's a little scattered. No one around me knows the true extent to how I feel and it feels like I'm going through it all alone.  


I've never felt this low about my appearance and self-image. Looking into the mirror makes me feel disgusting. Nobody knows that I've started to restrict calories (except for a new therapist I've started seeing) and my family think that everything's all okay. I feel like I have nobody to talk to. I miss the way that I was before - I miss eating and not caring about the outcome. I miss looking into the mirror and feeling beautiful. I miss looking into the mirror and even feeling neutral about myself.  


I think that people who come into are eventually going to leave - specifically in regards to relationships. It makes dating online impossible because I feel like once they see me in real life, or get to know the 'real' me, they'll leave. Like I'm so disgusting that I'm not capable of being loved. I guess this is amplified because I experienced something like this last year, where someone I could see myself falling in love with just stopped talking to me one day, and then moved on to someone else a few weeks later. My self-image was already falling then, but from them on it's gotten so much worse.  
Today a new guy I was speaking to randomly just ghosted me - I know it's not a big deal because I didn't know him very long at all, but it's feeding into the idea that I'm not capable of being loved. Like everybody is going to leave eventually, and it's only a matter of time. I hate that I want to be loved so badly, but I think I just want someone to see the positive in me, the positives I'm finding impossible to find in myself.

  
The idea that someone could find me attractive is so disgusting to me I don't think I could ever imagine it - I would just wonder why they do and why they don't go for someone better. I can't see myself in a relationship but I want to experience love. I feel like I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life.

  
I don't really know what I'm asking for in this post, but maybe some reassurance. I feel so alone. I feel like I'm at war with my body and it feels impossible to just exist.

550,Is it normal to shift from feeling numb to sad and it doesn’t stop?,"I fit the full criteria for depression, and I’m aware that emotional numbness is common in depression. I guess I just don’t know if I’m experiencing it. I’ve read the symptoms for emotional numbness/ emptiness and I completely relate to them all but it’s not constant. It lasts a couple minutes sometimes hours maybe a couple days, but then I suddenly start crying or feel the urge to cry, but no tears come out or I start feeling incredibly sad, maybe anxious because I struggle with anxiety or angry because I think about how hopeless my life is and various other things. I guess I just keep shifting from those moods to feeling empty again, it’s just not constant but it doesn’t stop coming back out of nowhere. Sometimes I can’t even tell if I feel okay or numb, I just imagine something that would usually make me happy and realize that I couldn’t care less about it, but if I start dwelling on my thoughts for too long I start feeling a bit sad, but it goes away after a second and my mind just goes blank or I stop feeling again. It really depends on the day, some days it’s hard for me to feel, others I still feel numb but it can be broken pretty easily.

My friends are really supportive, nice, and kind, but still, I feel I need to keep up this persona for them. If I trauma dump or seem like I’m too much—even though they’ve never told me—I worry it’s only a matter of time before they will. I fear I will eventually lose them because I’m emotionally needy, or at least I think I am. They’ve never mentioned it, but I know in my heart they think it. I’ve been friends with some for 4 years, another since 2016, and one has been my friend since the 9th grade. But no matter what they say, I will always be scared they secretly hate me. My therapist said I try to control everyone’s perception of me, so I create a persona in hopes that they will like me. I just feel I’ve already burdened them with so many of my problems, they don’t need more stress or for me to be needy. I told her I bought them something for being too much for them. She asked, “Have they ever taken it and said yes, you are a lot?” I said no, and she said, “There you go.”

I still get so scared.

I’m really scared to admit this to anyone, but I really just want to be hugged and to let someone let me cry on them while I wonder why I’m like this, why nobody loves me, or why I can’t accept that people actually love me and want me to be myself. I just really need this.

Why does it have to be the ending of my life, but I honestly don’t have a choice. 

It sucks when it feels like your fp doesn’t care, the one person you want to care the most. I feel like i pushed her to far, that’s why I don’t listen to people when they say I need to talk to people especially friends about how I’m feeling 

It’s kind of funny that when I was drunk I was thinking about the future and really trying to plan it to figure out how to make my life better. But now that I’m crashing I’m back to thinking about “giving up” I can’t keep living like this, and I can’t say that everytime I’m drunk I’m feeling better bc a lot of the time I’m sad and overthinking drunk, but I don’t want to have to be drunk all the time to feel okay. 

My mental health is so bad rn I really don’t know what to do anymore. Cutting doesn’t even help anymore 
 
I think it’s inevitable tbh. I think it just has to happen. I’m sick and there’s nothing I or anyone else can do to fix that 
Honeslty think I’m gonna end it soon. Nothing makes me feel alright. And I’m not telling anyone either cuz theyll try and stop me or just make me feel bad about it.I just feel so goddamn alone.
Ik I said it a couple of weeks ago but hopefully Monday will be the day.

I was right downers make me feel way worse and like shit uppers make me feel so much better. Now I want more which is what I was told would happen so.

553,Im not scared of ending it,"
I’m about to buy a gun to kill myself. I’m not really scared of death.

I just have to keep asking myself the important questions.

What do you have to look forward to?

Nothing.

Have you ever been happy?

No

Have you ever had any friends? Have you ever been in a position where you thought you could make real friends?

No

Do you have people that you would feel comfortable talking to? Do you have people that you would want in your life?

No

Are you willing to put an effort into changing yourself?

No

Are you open to believing that your life wasn’t a series of scripted interactions, with a bunch of randos pschoanalyzing you in the bg waiting to see if you full on commit to the delusion or just fucking kill yourself?

No

Are you ready to fight against your body’s physical reaction to imminent death.

Yes. It’s like being nervous before a Big Test or Tryouts or an interview. Hearts going to pound, mind is going to race, you just got to execute through it.",1b2ud3a,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2ud3a/im_not_scared_of_ending_it/

And now my business where I worked for the past several years is closing and I just… I don’t know what I’m gonna do.

The only thing I’ve been able to do is sleep more than 12 hours a day and binge watch Brooklyn 99 in attempt to have something to smile about. Unsuccessful. 

I called the cops on the person I’ve been with for more than four years for physically assaulting me. It happened after both of us having too much to drink and then getting into a stupid argument. One thing led to another and I ended up with blood all over my face (rubber guard on my glasses broke and gouged my eyebrow) and his hands around my neck. I have awful bruises all over my body, including my face. Today was my first day back to work, and the looks from my coworkers/guests (I’m a server) were too much. I felt like I was going to throw up over every single one of my tables, or burst into tears at any moment.   
   
I feel so fucking alone and heartbroken. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. We had dreams of owning a home soon. Maybe starting a family. We enjoy so many of the same activities together. My mom is constantly texting me and sharing prayers, which makes me feel even more alone because I’m not religious (she knows this). She said at one point “life isn’t always easy”. As if I didn’t learn this from her divorce I went through as a child, my brother dying, and me not finished college as a result of the depression I went into immediately. My dad barely talks to me. My friends are doing the best they can, but I feel like I’m a hole. Every time I think I’ve cried all the tears I possibly can, more come. Every time I eat I throw up. Every time I sleep I dream of him, good and bad.   

I went to Lacasa (idk if that’s like, a state wide thing, but where I live it’s a facility for support for domestic abuse, child abuse, etc) and they provide free therapy. I should have been in therapy long ago. I was never a heavy drinker until my younger brother died from an accidental shooting six years ago.

It’s hard being in here in the apartment with all these things that remind me of him. I hate this stupid bed without him. I hate everything that happened. I hate myself.   
  
We can’t talk because the court issued a no contact order. He was here a couple days ago with a deputy to collect his belongings. They only gave him 15 minutes, and we weren’t allowed to communicate. He asked the man if he could ask me a question. Officer said no. He asked again a couple minutes later and I told the officer I was fine with it, but he said the judge wouldn’t be okay with that. I didn’t want to do this to him, I love him so much, I know if we had both been sober it would have never happened. I miss getting texts from him while I’m at work, and like an idiot I kept checking my phone tonight. I miss his smile and the way he always makes me laugh. I miss having him come home excited to talk about his work with me. My mom insisted on taking me out to dinner, and I completely lost it when she suggested the wing bar up the road that him and I would always go to.   
  
I drove home from work in silence instead of listening to music or calling him to say I’m on my way home. Sat in the driveway screaming and crying for several minutes.

584,unsure of TMS and feeling attached to my depression. ,"I’m still on my parents insurance and have been struggling with a bad depressive episode since September. I’ve been depressed since I was 11 and I’m 19 now and am diagnosed with MDD, dysthymia, and I think seasonal depression (it’s been a bit since I’ve looked at my records). My mom suggested TMS which is covered by our insurance for the most part, and I’ve had friends who had the treatment and it worked well for them. 

The thing is, idk if I actually want my depression to go away completely? Idk who I am without it. Sometimes I wish I was still 11 and I didn’t know why I was sad or what was happening. I’m medicated and they work, but i haven’t been able to feel positive since my meds make me numb/ neutral (better than suicidal). What if It takes away a part of me. I hate it and how it makes me feel, but I’m still scared of losing my depression. It would help a lot since my depressive episodes can trigger my psychosis or mania, and I hate feeling suicidal- but, sometimes I like rotting or being numb. It hurts but it reminds me I’m alive and human. What if I can’t feel like me without my mental illness? I’ve spent so long feeling isolated due to my symptoms, what if people don’t like me when I don’t have them. What if the problems stay the same and it was for nothing. I have so many other issues to focus on. Im nervous it’s bad for me to think this way. I already am upset with myself over a plethora of things, I don’t wanna make things worse. 

I just hope I’m not the only person who is attached to their depression in a way that (I think for me at least) is unhealthy. I feel bad but don’t have any friends I can really talk too. Just my family and I don’t like making them worry ",1b2mgj8,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2mgj8/unsure_of_tms_and_feeling_attached_to_my/
585,How to “break up” with a therapist?,"I feel like my therapist is really not helping me with my mental health issues. I mean…she’s alright to talk to for an hour every week, but it’s just not worth the time and money. She is the only person outside of work that I speak to, period. However I am a very solitary person by nature and have been in the position of having no one in my life more often than I *have*, so that is not a huge concern for me. The problem is that I feel too bad to break it off. I’ve been seeing her for about three years every week and I feel like I would owe her an explanation at this point. Some of the issues I DO need help with are standing up for myself, being assertive, saying no, initiating difficult conversations, etc. and my inability to “fire her” is a perfect example of that, and how I have not advanced in the slightest in those areas since beginning therapy with her.

590,Got my dream job in my dream city and I’m still depressed and can’t do it properly. ,"I worked my ass off in college trying to run from my depression. I always had 2-3 jobs at a time and in 4 years I finished 2 different degrees where none of the classes overlapped and Chinese as a minor. Ya know, just to really ensure I suffered. But I pushed through hoping the other end would get better. 

I later was diagnosed with a chronic physical illness that took over my life. I slowly managed to work again and to manage my symptoms. Eventually I got a decent job that propelled me to try law school. I entered law school in the fall of 2019. Spring 2020 everything went remote. My depression got worse and I barely passed. But I pushed through hoping the other end would get better. 

I got into a relationship in 2017. COVID nearly broke us. But I pushed through. The other side with this person had to be better. 

The bar exam was the worst thing I have ever experienced relating to feeling the stress physically in my body. The three days before the exam I was so stressed out I experienced one never ending panic attack to the point where I thought I’m either going to pass the exam or literally drop dead trying. I think I’m still recovering and probably have a baby dose of PTSD from the experience. I pushed through hoping the other end would be better. I passed by the skin of my teeth. 

By sheer luck and privilege I managed to find a great mentor who got me my dream job in my dream city despite my mediocre GPA. I moved to a place with decent healthcare for my chronic illness. My partner and I are now long distance while they find a job to move out here with me. I get to do the work that I loved every day with incredible attorneys showing me the way. And I’m still depressed. 

The problem is, it’s now affecting my ability to do the dream job. I butchered my last oral argument because I just couldn’t bring myself to prepare enough. I’m on my third day off work “sick” because I just can’t. I’m already chronically late because I can barely get out of bed most mornings. If I don’t go in tomorrow I’m sure I’m risking my job. The very thing I pushed so hard to get past to achieve my
dreams is now physically preventing me from doing the dream job. I’m so terrified that maybe I can’t be an attorney after all. And it wasn’t because I wasn’t smart enough or didn’t work hard enough. It’s because I’m depressed. And it’s bullshit. ",1b2qs8g,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2qs8g/got_my_dream_job_in_my_dream_city_and_im_still/

601,I thought I'd die before I was 21. I'm 25 now and I don't know what to do.,"Growing up, I was convinced I would die before I was 21. Not in a suicide way (though yes, I was suicidal) and not because I was sick or terminal or anything; I thought I was going to die in a car crash. Completely convinced, to the point where I didn't get any driver's license until I was 18. My dad literally had to drag me to the car to practice, and tricked me into driving onto the highway (where I pulled off at the next exit with the worst panic attack of my life). 

The point is, I was always convinced I would die before 21. I even had a deal with myself that I would kill myself before my birthday ""just in case."" It seemed like a long time away when I was 13, when I originally thought of his compromise. But then my 21st birthday happened and I geared myself up to finally do the deed... But I didn't. I don't know what stopped me... fear, maybe?

So the years kept coming. I got some therapy. Not a lot - can't afford it - but I started getting a little better. I finished college, tried to work for a few years, went back to college when I couldn't find work with my degree. I'm no longer actively suicidal; I don't have a plan anymore, but I still consider it on occasion. There are good days, bad days, but mostly gray days, where nothing seems particularly good or bad. 

Functionally, though... I think I'm still waiting to die. I'm not really proactive about anything in my life. I had dreams of writing books for a living, but I can't even work up the energy to keep going. The days keep going by so fast and I feel like I'm wading through molasses, and at any moment I could miss my step and fall up to my neck in my own nonsense. I self-sabotage, I procrastinate, I'm deep in a victim complex that I hate but I keep falling back into because its easier.

I tried to stay away from her friendships and changing enviroment, but I live in a very small city and It's almost impossible avoiding It at all.

610,I keep hiding and not living,"I have struggled with depression for the last 20 years. It comes and goes in waves---there are times when I'm really down and out, and then times where I really feel like I'm functioning normally.

Lately, I've come to realize my Iow-key depression that is more pervasive, and that's expressed through this pattern of coming home every night and watching t.v., eating junk food, then getting up and doing it all over again. Even on the weekends when I have time off, I start the day feeling hopeful about all the things I might do, then end up spending hours watching movies. 

I can recognize now that this is also depression---it's the fear of living life, of putting myself out there. It's so much easier and more comfortable to hide, to avoid taking risks or being seen.

I'm at the point now where I'm sick of this. I'm sick of myself wallowing all the time and not doing anything fun or productive. Yet no matter what I tell myself, I can't seem to make a change. It's like my feet are stuck in concrete. 

I want to change. I want to save myself and get better, I want to make healthy choices for myself that make me feel good and bring fulfillment to my life.

I just can't seem to figure out how to do it. How can a behavioral pattern like this go on for years, even when there is the desire to live differently?

It is the worst kind of stuck feeling.

615,This shit sucks. ,"This shit sucks, doesn’t it? I’ve been depressed for well over decade. Only recently it’s been severely more intense and longer lasting. Ordinarily I’d surround myself with distractions to trick myself into forgetting it, but not now. I have everything, anxiety, depression, rumination, insecurities and creating scenarios that have a fraction of a percentage of happening. Usually it’s only 1 or 2 that bother me, lately it’s all 5. I’ve set myself an unattainable bar of expectations and standards for myself but always fall short. 

My wife doesn’t get it, she cannot empathize with me. I’m a 40 year old guy with average male friends who won’t understand either. I’ve toyed with therapy but I think I’m too far gone tbh. It feels like my mind is torturing me, thoughts are slowly killing me. Nothing I can say or do will change it. 

The fucked up part that I feel like I deserve it, like I’m being punished for something. I don’t feel I deserve happiness, only suffering. I’m mentally and physically exhausted from putting on an act. Always the funny guy who loves making people laugh, always “on”, always willing to help others when I can’t even help myself. I was days away from ending it, had it all planned. My wife saw how I was a shell of myself and finally allowed me to open up to her, it was well received. But it keeps coming back. It never leaves. It can be triggered by literally anything. A word, an image, a memory that chains into other memories, a thought. It’s been compiling for years and years. I replay things I’ve said and done that hurt people for almost 2 decades over and over. I feel too much and it’s slowly poisoning me. I’ve never known what it’s like to truly feel loved. 

Not really sure wtf the point of this post is, maybe it’s my way of saying we are all in this shit together and we’re not alone. Maybe it’s just me venting even though I’ve said this almost verbatim before. At any rate, finding someone to talk to is helpful. Just verbalizing it can do wonders. That seems to be the only thing that helps me. Unfortunately it’s at the expense of the people I love. ",1b2nehl,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2nehl/this_shit_sucks/
616,Something I Want to Say,"Okay, you all know what the furry fandom is? I joined the fandom since I was 12. I had fallen into love with the community and the people, but yes, I was still very young at that time. I did not realize or get to see the bad part of the fandom. 

2 years have passed, and now I've seen everything. Ever since I have been trying to argue against the furry fandom in order to find a way and reform it before anything worse could happen. I want to let people stop being degenerates and act like normal people, but furry. 

I've been stressing on too much of the fandom, I am an artist. I draw a lot of things about the fandom and listing ways on how to change them. Recently, my parents began to wonder if i had been getting into porn or other type of stuff, and they confiscated my electronics. Which is a huge disadvantage since I had already mastered the way to draw.

I now feel like my parents gave up completely on me, and they won't even help me at anything. My grades have been dropping ever since. I don't think this is my problem, it's all because of the furry fandom. I am overwhelmed to change it, I cannot turn back because I had seen already too much to leave the fandom. I have to make them learn what they've done.

It only deteriorated my mental health even more. School, grades, drawing, writing, debating... 

I mean I can just kill myself any time now, but if I die, who's gonna be there to change the furry community? Who's going to show them how son of a bitch they really are?

621,Depressed overseas fiancé isolating and pushing everyone away. Should I visit or leave him alone?,"My fiancé became really depressed over loosing some money. When he’s severely depressed he isolates, drinks too much and barely eats. He ignores everyone, doesn’t reply to texts or answer calls.

At the start of this episode he sent me a breakup text saying he is over the distance and doesn’t like that we could be apart for another two years while we wait for a visa to my country. He didn’t give me a chance to say I’d be willing to move there because he immediately blocked al contact. We’ve been together 3.5yrs and engaged over a year.

I feel like he pushed me away so he was free of all obligations and could sink into doom and gloom alone. I’m not sure it was a serious breakup as he has done this once before when depressed.

No one has heard from him and his mum and I are really worried. I am worried he might also be suicidal. I’m thinking to go and visit, to take care of him for a week or so as he doesn’t have anyone there. I think he would appreciate this but I’m not sure.

I get depressed too but I’m not the type to isolate completely and push everyone out of the way. So I don’t know if a visit might be too much.

630,I felt dead inside ever since I went through that one day...,"I was never on good terms with my parents. When I was a kid they used to beat me and yell at me constantly. I always had to lie that I love them to avoid trouble. At the age of 16, I became severely suicidal, not just because of my family but because of many other things that I don't even have the strength to talk about. During this time I was doing something so stupid I genuinely want to slap myself in the face for: I used to cut myself. It was the stupidest coping mechanism I used because I didn't think about what would happen if any of my family members found out... And they eventually did... One day, my sleeve slightly rolled up and my mom noticed a few scars, I quickly tried to pull it down and act as if nothing happened but she forcefully rolled it up again and saw what I did. 

She told my dad immediately after that. He banged into my room asking me to show him what I did, then he repeatedly kept asking me why I did it. I couldn't respond, I genuinely didn't know what to say. Eventually he started threatening me how he'll punch me in the face if I don't tell him, so I was forced to say something. The words that came out of my mouth were ""because I wanted to kill myself..."", guess what he did? He first started making fun of me, then he started insulting me and my suicidality and was also saying how he does everything for me and how I have no reasons to be unhappy (which is a lie btw). 

He then took my phone away, forced me to walk to the store to buy food and then forced me to read some book about god or something. I tried talking with my mom, I asked her could we talk but the only thing she said was ""do you understand what you did to me today mentally..."" Like ???

My dad eventually came into the room and wanted to talk, I managed to lie about it and said that I actually feel completely okay right now and that I used to do that because I was frustrated and what not. The day afterwards went as if nothing happened and to this day we talk as that whole day never happened. That happened two years ago.

632,Confused,"Hello, idk why I decided to make a post here but I guess i havent spoke with somebody about my feelings for a long time, maybe it will help.
Im 25m and I feel like ive been dealing with “depression” since I was a child, i was never diagnosed because I ve never been to therapy but I guess thats what youd call how Im feeling.
Its hard even for me to explain but to give you some context, i was raised by an abusive alcoholic mother and an absent father.I actually remember that I used to be happy because I have never experienced something else outside of my family, so basically the  stuff i was going trough seemed normal to me until I grew up, id say 12yo, and started to look around and see other people s life, I think that really put me down, because I started to feel like I am not good enough, not smart enough and I deserved everything that happened.
Right now I dont talk to my mother anymore because she never changed, she is still one toxic woman, my father is living in a different country but everytime me or my sister tried to talk to him and open up about our experiences he never sided with us, he sided with our mother, so i keep a low contact with him also.
Im at a confusing point in my life, I cant really make meaningful connections, I feel sad all the time and it gets even worse thinking this is going to be my life now, since my “mind” hasnt changed in that aspect much, feels like im just waiting for the time to pass and die, cant seem to find joy in anything anymore.

I had to have an oblation to sever some of the scar tissue that was making my heart beat improperly. any unnecessary strain I put on my body makes the scar tissue grow more so I had to quit my dream job as an arborist and started my own company. we made an agreement that since this was the case she couldnt quit her job or do anything that would jeopardize her position unless she could get all of her credit cards paid off and already had another job lined up. 4 days after i made the transition to running my own company she went on loa for no good reason and dove head first into a bottle. she hasnt paid any of her cards off so I have been paying close to 5k a month in interest absolutely negating any money I was making (she thinks by paying that interest every month that she is building credit) on top of that she has pulled out several loans that I am now responsible for paying by default. she has spent every dime that I had put back to pay my taxes so now the IRS is coming after me. she has refused to find a new job and cant go back to her other one but they wont technically fire her (they want her to resign so they dont have to pay unemployment) i need another operation or im going to die but I cant get it because our health system in the US wont deal with me without the insurance I used to have through her work.

636,I’m lost.,"    I’m a 34m and have dealt with depression/anxiety for as long as I can remember. When I was 27 I met who I believed was the woman I would spend the rest of my life with. Seven years later she wanted a divorce. I would’ve been ok with that decision if it hadn’t come out of the blue. We had our problems like many couples, but I was under the impression that she and I were working on our issues together.
    She didn’t even have the courage to come out and say she wanted a divorce. It took me to ask “so are we getting a divorce?” And she responded with “I think that would be best.” The weirdest part is when people would ask how we were doing. We would both tell them that we were getting a divorce. I was torn up and really sad about the whole thing. She was going around almost bragging according to some of the friends I had. She was telling people “it’s what we both want” with a smile on her face. I was clear with her that divorce was not what I wanted.
    Fast forward about another month, I find out she’s been cheating on me with a coworker. Even with hard evidence, she denied it. It pushed me to some pretty dark places. All I wanted was for her to admit and acknowledge that she hurt me and she couldn’t do that. I found out around September and continued living with her until just before Christmas because of our son. I moved away to be around family and friends again. I recently got my son back from her.
    I’ve only been away from her coming up on two months and there is no sign of getting any better. I feel completely lost and I’m having to walk around pretending like everything is fine for my son and the other people in my life. I feel like a burden. She ruined my faith in myself and other people. I truly believe that she is a covert narcissist, as her behavior throughout the seven years lines up with those behaviors.
    I don’t know what to do or how to cope. People tell me to that the healing is going to take awhile and seeing as how I’ve dealt with what many people believe to be narcissistic abuse, it could be longer. I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel and there is absolutely nothing that gets my mind off of it. I’ve tried everything that people have suggested and I can’t clear my head of any of it.

My girlfreind is depressed, we went long distance because I have school far away, and I feel like we have been just drifting, whenever I ask her if she is ok, or is we are, she gets paranoid. Its so bad, that we went on a three day break, and to be honest it kind of helped, for a few days shit felt back to normal, I even manged to visit, and we were rigth back in that lovy dovy spirit. Then I came back up here, and its worse than ever. I barely manage to get resonses it feels like, sometimes anyway, she still says I love you, and drunk texts me, but sober her is a different story, I can tell that things are just falling apart. we recently called, and she refused to say a word, she just wanted to hear my voice, so I talked, about random cutesy BS, and she would rspond over text, and honestly it was so conflicting, I was glad that she was happy to hear me, but so depressed that i couldnt get the mutual gratification. we called again the next day, and it was so... Awkward. I feel like there is no healthy way this can continue, but at the same time I could see myself marrying her in the future.

I havent ever been suicidal before, but Im really thinking about it so much lately, like this little voice in my head, it tells me to do it. I dont think I will, but Im scared. generally, im such an anxious person, like this never ending knot in my stomach that will never go away. lately, its just gotten worse and worse and worse. I feel like everything I do is destroying everyone and everything around me, my gf is perpetually hurt by my mere existance, I am on a spiral of self destruction, I constantyl lie to my family, i have never missed so many classes in my life. I feel like I've peaked, everything from here on out is the downward spiral, and the only thing that keeps me here, is this never ending, feeling of a narccistic importance, that I will do something that everyone will be helped by. Some sort of weird motive that pushes me to not die, but to hate living as well, like i will somehow rally thousands of people to pull the lower classes from their never ending misery and into the new age. Honestly, for so long I couldnt figure out what my deal is, but I'm just crazy. and depressed. two things that go hand in hand. is there anything i can do to fix any of this? do I just have to live in constant pain, what steps should I take? do you any of you relate to any of this?",1b2k78r,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2k78r/im_not_sure_where_to_start_i_just_want_someone_to/
642,lost all my interest in my career and the goals that i planned for," 

Hi everyone ,

Im 20 (F) currently going through a tough phase in my life right ow , i feel so lost , so anxious and stressed all the time that it causes me frequent headaches

i feel so distracted with my schedule and i can't feel the same enthusiasm i used to feel when i first started working ....

so to give a context , back in 2021 I passed my high school with a decent scoring although I'm average at studies . after high school I enrolled in B.A English (hons) from a good university but the thing is i really didnt choose my graduation subject wisely at the time it was mainly under the influence of friend suggestions and english being one of the subjects in which i scored highest in my high school and even though the first semester was kinda fine i was coming to a realization slowly i don't like the subject itself .

also during my first year of college , my family's financial condition went really downhill ... So with the help of some loan , family and friends and a business partner , me and my mother somehow managed to open a small dance studio on our own because at the time we really thought it is one of the easy businesses to do , doesn't require much capital to run and also because we had a business partner to guide us for further steps

i guess that this was one of the turning points in my life cause i really love dancing but before the studio it was more like a hobby since my family always gave priority to studies and wanted me to study hard and land up in a big corporate job so i never really got a chance to pursue my interest in dancing but after we started the studio , it really took us one whole year just to setup our operations , understanding the dance and dancing as a business while managing our finances and other things.

during this one year , i actually ended up dropping out of college and didn't tell anyone at the time cause even i was not sure what degree to pursue in its place plus i was also not feeling comfortable sharing this anyone since i was embarrassed they might make fun of me ...

so instead i decided to pursue dancing as a career , now its been 2 years since then .... things were going kinda good except one of my professor ended up calling my parents to report them that i had dropped out and then i had listen to the taunts and stuff even while managing the studio operations while learning how to dance ....

i did make a goal list though and i was able to achieve small goals at the start and i even had planned to complete my graduation with a different degree as 2024 starts...

But as of now lately ever since 2024 started , i dont feel motivated enough to do anything , not even studies , not even dancing and not even doing art and graffiti ( my part time comfort hobby ) I have lost all interest and even my financial condition is also not good .... i tried taking a break and then returning back to work but nothing is working ... i keep forgetting the class timings , dont really practice or rehearse like i used to and worst of all i have lost my creativity .... there is so much going around i dont really know how to sort things ...

sorry for my English its not that good but thanks for reading till here",1b26rqh,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b26rqh/lost_all_my_interest_in_my_career_and_the_goals/

647,Is it depression or my reality?,"I’m conflicted. I have these days where I feel so useless, pointless; effortless. I’m locked in my thoughts consistently and I can’t open up to anyone without the fear of burdening and imposing negative energy into them.

Even to a mental health professional it feels so odd to speak to someone I’ve never met in my life about issues that they have no interest in whatsoever, despite specialising in that area.

I have been affected by two brain hemorrhages (‘08 & ‘16) which has caused long lasting effects to my memory. It’s almost as if I was two different people from before and after and everyone tries to make me become the person I once was, completely discrediting the person that I am today. It’s been difficult coping with myself and who I am and it makes everything even more harder when I’m being compared to my old self.

I was recently fired from my job last month in January which has now locked me indoors for majority of my time. My last relationship ended in 2022 and that left me distraught, affected and I know a lot of emphasis and laughter relate around “trauma” but this genuinely had me distressed and in a mental chokehold. I self harmed during the end of that year and never told anyone. Locked and buried that inside of me. I had been involved with another person during the first to second quarter of last year but that ended immediately and never even passed the three month mark.

I’m lost in myself. I don’t have a purpose or reason for being whatsoever. I don’t know which direction to steer. I’m at a constant standstill. There are moments where I push through and do well but other days I’m stuck.

Those around me always tell me to change my way of thinking and while I agree it’s beneficial long term, it’s much more easier said than done. It’s become me and this is who I am. I’m constantly defeated by my actions and the things that I do I don’t understand.",1b2irnd,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2irnd/is_it_depression_or_my_reality/
648,I am confused,"I am so confused on whether or not all of this is my fault.

For Context 

I am a 16 MTF and My Ex partner is a 16 M

This all stems a while back to issues we had in our old relationship with a lot of arguing and me sometimes saying I didn't forgive them I was all around a terrible person but when I look back at it now I don't know who that person was, I know it was me but I also don't know why those things happened I feel abusive and I know in part I was but I felt so hurt by my partner that everytime I would mention some boundaries or things that needed to be changed they would be crossed. I would get so angry and he would handwrite apologies and such but things would never change and I didn't forgive him and i feel so stupid now because that's not the way I am anymore. 

However a lot more things happened and they continue to blame me for almost all of it if anyone is interested you can DM me and I'll tell you more but I just I feel like for some reason this is really all my fault and now he's going to leave me again and I'm so scared od him getting with someone else due to all the insecurities I have

TL;DR
My Ex partner and I started talking again 2 months ago after being broken up for 4 to 5 months without talking much they came back a while ago and we had a falling out yesterday now I'm getting left again because he doesn't think I've changed

Pretending like what I went through didn't change me. Didn't destroy a part of me. After her death, I spiraled. It was like losing my mother. I made horrible decisions that still haunt me now.

This really fucks with my head and perception of reality. Even though I say my personality is being replaced, my wreck of a brain instantly corrects me:

""Replaced by what, exactly? What was there before?""


And I can't fucking remember...

It all began years ago,  with me sometimes questioning myself, at the heights of depressive episodes. I would stop whatever I'm doing, and literally ask myself out loud: ""What am I doing here? What for? Why shoudn't I just walk out the window right now?"" I'm stuck in a loop of these questions, now they never go away.

I keep trying to remember who and how I was, before depression, when I was a teen. I just can't remember. How did I overcome my past traumas, big and small, how did I react both mentally and physically? How the fuck did I endure abusive parents and their divorce, poverty, deaths of closest friends, betrayals and a broken heart, busted nerves and bones, doesn't matter. Where the fuck is that mental strength, where did it go? Why I fall apart and disintegrate into pieces now over the smallest of inconviniences, when in past I could take soul-crushing crippling events and not kill myself?

Everything is covered in mist, I can't clear this fog out. Depersonalization, derealization, I guess. Perhaps it's some kind of a defense mechanism, just brain trying to distance my present self from past self?
Or I guess I'm finally going nuts after seventeen years of enduring depression.

661,Depression isn’t letting me feel love,"I’ve been dating my partner for over 2 years. The first months were amazing, we were a perfect match, we felt in love, we had so much in common and did everything together with all the happiness in the world (as much as my mild depression let me, of course). Now my condition has gotten worse, and I can’t enjoy the relationship anymore. I still believe she’s the perfect person, caring, sweet, supporting, she has tried to understand me and never made fun of me nor invalidated me. She even cried sometimes because of how bad she felt for me

I know she’s the perfect person, but I can’t tolerate being in a relationship with her. Why? Because she’s my main obsessive comparison and my depression (and ocd) continuously tells me that I am inferior to her in all ways and I can’t help but feel tremendously bad and upset about it. It has even created a grudge against her, even if she never did anything malicious to me. But in my subconscious, she has. So now I am irritable, impatient, insensitive, and I talk dryly because I can’t tolerate any sign of love happening. I can’t tolerate her loving a piece of trash like me. I constantly tell her to go find someone better and to leave me alone, to forget about me, forget my existence, even if I know that’s the last thing I would want and it’d destroy me. But I don’t know how else to cope

A bit of context, we are the same age, she started university a year after me due to her school having an additional year, and yet I failed most my exams and eventually my career till I had to drop out last November, to start a new one where I’m already doing bad. She, instead, has made it to 4th year with only one failed exam and many high marks. 

She also looks so much better physically, she has such unique looks like gorgeous green eyes while I have plain brown (she got compliments on them and I have never been complimented for my looks). Similarly happens with other body parts that I have ugly and she looks like a model (we’re both girls so the comparisons are worse)

She is stronger, has more will and resilience. I am a quitter and sleep like a bear while she could go for a week sleeping only 2 hours 

She has skills and talents, she’s awesome at piano and drawing, I’ve drawn my whole life, went to academies, but I’m not good at it. I’ve also tried instruments and I sucked. I sucked at everything I’ve tried (music, sports, martial arts, science, etc) this and a lot more.

All of this has lead me to not be sure if I love her anymore. I feel like I do as I want to cuddle her and I love seeing anything related to her, but this frustration sometimes makes me be insensitive and I hurt her, or can’t care if she’s crying anymore. I also feel like I’m treating her badly because she’s making me feel this bad even without meaning it. I don’t want to lose her but I don’t want to continue hurting her and become a monster either, but she sobs every time I tell her we should part ways and tells me she can’t let go of me.

Is this normal to feel thanks to these conditions? Am I a monster? What is going on? Is it possible love is still there?",1b2gkoe,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2gkoe/depression_isnt_letting_me_feel_love/

667,I am stuck with a hot tempered and irritable bf who can't work and earn money and I want to cry,"Me (29f) and he (28m). We've been together for 5 years now. We met online and were LDT, then he moved to my country after 6 month of relationship (I know it was too soon). Back in his country he was working in a factory for 5 years. And I didn't know the job will be a problem.

He can't find and keep a job. He can't earn money. He feels ok leaching over me. He has mental problems which make him kinda inept towards working. He shouts at me often and he says it's bcs I've done or said something stupid. He has social anxiety and doesn't talk irl with anyone except me. He gets mad over minor things like electricity blackout for a minute or internet losing connection. He stomps and throws things. And we don't have money so he could get a therapy over his anger and mental blocks (and he only agrees to medical therapy).

We have good moments but it's like 40% good 60% bad.

I wanted to break up with him after a year of relationship. But till this day I can't. Bcs he moved to my country and I feel like I'm responsible for him. If I break up with him he's gonna be homeless and suicide. I can't live with such a guilt through the rest of my life so I'm still with him. We don't have enough money to live apart (cause he doesn't have money). I've only accepted my fate that I have to find him a good job somehow and he could provide himself so I could leave. But that's a very hard task and I have my own problems.

That's not how I imagined my 23 to 29 year's old. I feel pity abt myself. Why I couldn't pick some who could at least work at provide himself and didn't have so many mental problems. I aged a lot. I'm broke. I wish I better didn't have relationship at all then with him. Or I could find someone awesome and have happy 23-29 years old. But no.

It's rant and cry for help at the same time. It's self hatred for picking him and bringing him here. But I won't listen your advice, I will sleep and tomorrow pretend like everything is fine and I'm fine being shouted and broke.",1b2fsth,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2fsth/i_am_stuck_with_a_hot_tempered_and_irritable_bf/

You don't need to think about it much, all you need to do is learn to have fun"", yet I've never had any fun. I don't want to seem selfish so I made the assumption that if I were to listen to them, maybe they would listen to me. But they never did. All they did is talk about how hard their life are, how hard it is to have a difficult situation to live in. Then what about my feeling? Does it not matter to anyone? All they did is gaslight me into thinking that I have never thought of anyone else's feelings. I want to actually know how does it feel to cry a hug by someone you love. To cry my heart out.

I’m such a difficult person to be around with. I ruin everything I touch. I’m not a person. I am just a sack of meat filled with overwhelming emotions. I’m so toxic. I’m just filled with rage, sadness and bitterness. I’m so useless. I’m worthless.

If who I really was showed on the external, no one would dare look my way. If my insides showed on the outside, I would have bloody eyes, raw skin that’s been clawed at, a rotting brain and decaying organs, I’d have a heart that’s swollen and ready to explode and my lungs would be purple from all the anxiety. 

If I slept with guys looking like my internal self, they would shoot themsleves. If my ex’s see the real damage inside, they would count their blessings. 

Everyone tells me I’m beautiful but they would kill themsleves from the darkness if it’s reflected externally on me. I can’t believe what anyone ever says. I feel like a corpse that’s always embalming myself when I get dressed and post.

I am not human. I never was. I came out of my mom rotting. I’ve been walking this world soulless. A cockroach can’t be compared to the filth that I am. 

I can’t connect. I can’t love. I can’t learn. I can’t regulate. I can’t be calm. I am a forest fire. I will burn and burn myself and everything around me till there’s nothing left. 

I am the problem and always have been. No amount of cleansing can cleanse the darkness that resides within me. Nothing can drain out the poison in me. 

I am not a sweet girl.

I don't know how to help her, and having already lost a loved one to suicide, I am praying and screaming to the forces that be that she stays with us. I have never seen someone's soul crack open so thoroughly. I see my country actively ignoring calls for peace and even funding this, and when you see the pictures of little Abdullah \[not real names used\] who would have been 13 or Jamal who just got a bike, it's so impossibly real just how bad things are - when you see their pictures, know their stories, see videos of family gatherings, it's... it's so different than just the stuff on the news. I see trans and nonbinary folks being literally beaten to death in bathrooms and I am afraid as a gender nonconforming person with a tenuous relationship with my gender identity (and a uterus, given how things are going). If I don't dress or look the way I'm supposed to, or if I don't do the prescribed things my sex is ""supposed"" to do, will this spread? Am I safe? I'm also saving as much as I can, but I am living in poverty in America and I am afraid every day I am going to be homeless. I feel hopeless, despite getting a degree from the ""right"" school and pursuing grad school. Money is tight. Food is tight. Healthcare is a terrifying thing. It keeps me up at night, not knowing if I will be housed or fed or clothed. Or if my test results come back bad for an illness my doc suspects I have, will the medication costs bleed me dry? My entire paternal side of the family has disowned me for refusing to go to my father's funeral - a man who beat me and hated me till his dying day and was an active member of the literal Ku Klux Klan. No shit, I didn't go to support that dude's memory. But now I've lost people I thought actually loved me - because I dared to say ""no, I will not venerate someone who lived and died with such hate in their heart"".

684,Key to happiness,"Hey guys,  
so, long story short:  
My dad killed himself 3 years ago, his father tried as well. I was 19 years old and watching after my younger sister. Had a hard time, but successfully got over it, even before that, I can't remember being happy from the age of 12. Below I show you my Key to happiness. Be balanced and read a lot!  
Key to happines  
  
\-	Analyze why your not happy  
\-	Analyze what makes you happy, or maybe could  
\-	Figure out how to change what makes you sad  
\-	Read books for knowledge and vocabulary  
\-	Work on it  
\-	Try to do what makes you happy and try a lot of different things  
  
While doing so, stay fit, eat healthy, brush your teeth, take cold showers, learn how to breathe correctly, learn about basic finance, work on yourself, and clarify your ideas for the future. Don’t give up to early and don’t  keep doing something you don’t like, except it gets you somewhere you want to get. Always follow your own Mesotes. Be positive and enjoy the process. If you forgive yourself right now and start doing all this, you will be happy. Keep in mind, what happened has already happened, you can’t change it. Look forward and enjoy the present. All you can possibly do now, is be the best version of yourself in the situation you are right now.   
  
Be disciplined, be hard to yourself and easy with others. Most of them don't have it easier than you have.  
Serenity to accept the things you cant change and courage to change those you can.

For the past few years, thinking and being with people has been tiring for me, I'm gradually losing everything, even my health, so the reason for this post is to ask you if anyone among me has had the problem of foul-smelling flatulence (probably due to constipation) as soon as your stress level and bad thoughts go up a lot during the day. 

**If yes**, how did you solve this darn problem? Is depression to blame for this problem, do you find? 

I can no longer walk around and sit in public places that my clothes despite having washed them still emit the strong odors of flatulence that I emit because of this intestinal problem of mine (secondary to stress and depression?).

691,Everything feels wrong in my life,"I feel so bad right now with my life, you know how as young people we always joke about suicide but never really mean what we say? well, for the first time in my life i thought of it and was not a joke. I wouldnt be able to do it (i think) since the picture of pain or suffering goes over my thoughts but im scared that im thinking about it so seriously.

&#x200B;

As a context, i grew in a house with a family that looks amazing but my father gets easily unstable and sometimes he gets really angry and puts all that anger on me, its been years since its physical but now its worst since most of the days he gets home to complain about me and the failure i am in a lot of aspects, he has said really bad stuff that im not comfortable sharing. besides that im in college and also work with my family, i cant focus on college since my father always points how ""im dedicated to my teachers but not him that is the one that pays them"" but i do my job and just make a few mistakes. I cant study since all the time im thinking about him getting home and hurt my feelings and make me feel bad. 

Also, i´ve never been a relationship guy since i grew seeing my fathers fighting. but about a year ago i met a girl in my friend group that i liked, we talked for a year and a half almost everyday and she fought with all our friends because she didnt work, however i stood with her and try to make her see that she was wrong but i was not leaving her. Multiple times i told her that if we were not gonna be in a relationship i didnt mind being friends but let me step away a little to solve my feelings, but she always came back and flirted.

By november we started dating but she left me 2 weeks ago and i found out she was dating a common friend since we started dating too, she said she never had feelings for me and just tried to and what was 1 year and a half of moments that i wanted to keep pretty on my mind turn into a lie. I didnt forgive her and i see her all weeks but we dont talk at all and she seems pretty fine with it. Hurted that the only person i ever loved just never cared about me.

I just got out of college exams on computer science with my heart broken and did poorly and now i dont feel motivated, i just dont want to study, work or even play, not even eating feels like a need which is new to me. Its my birthday in 2 weeks and i know im gonna be sad about it

I dont know what to do anymore, and i know other people deal with worst stuff and i feel bad for feeling this but i cant anymore.

I know no one might read this but saying a little how i feel without the bad details was the only way to let it out. If anyone did read it thanks for ""listening""",1b2ci2n,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b2ci2n/everything_feels_wrong_in_my_life/

695,Depressed Heartbroken Obsessing over girl I never dated,"I haven't really posted before on reddit so I'm not sure if there is a correct way to post this.   


I 29M have had a lot of mental issues like anxiety, low self esteem for a long time. I had other issues as well but I had just distracted myself and never really addressed them properly. For example, I've had a desire to be in a relationship for a long time, and get married as well due to religious reasons. It's just due to there always being an expectation that I would marry according to my parents' will, i.e have an arranged marriage, and there being less of a dating culture in Pakistan where I'm from, especially in my city, which is relatively small, the only opportunity I had of finding a relationship was online.  


Ok, so just realize, I had one proper relationship, at age 18, which was an online one, which lasted just 3 months, and I broke up with her because I was dumb and also emotional and self sabotage. I begged her to get back together with me and it took around 6 months and we did get back together but things weren't the same and we just broke up again. I am alone again. I did have a few crushes after that but honestly got my heart broken every time after that.   


Through High School and University then, I never really had a relationship, and was lonely, even though, I wanted to be in one. And there's a constant self resentment rising in me, because I was at best average at anything I did, even though my family supported me through everything and did their best to give me anything they wanted. This peaked, when my dad sold his car, just to be able to send me to Germany for my master's degree. But I was unable to get a job there, not even an odd job, due to the language barrier.  


In all of this situation, all my friends back home were already married and had families. And my online friends were also in loving relationships, and heading towards marriage, and some were already married. And my feeling of loneliness, kept increasing, and I would just keep myself distracted. In this time, my closest friends, who're a couple, bring a friend of theirs to our discord, and well, we'd recently started playing fortnite and she also played so when she came, she'd play with us and this is where the problem escalated. I just grew very fond of her, very quickly, because I think she just gave me just enough attention, more than I was used to from a girl and quickly grew feelings for her, even to the point of obsession, and behaved like an incel, like, trying to just stay in private call with her, as I was mainly felt threatened by some of the other guys there, of which one was a very close friend, but like very successful at things he did.  


Anyway, I accidentally let on that I liked her, and she said that she only wants to be friends. I, just for being with her, said I'll try just being friends as well but I couldn't. It came to a point where I was going through proper depression, unable to study, and it even came to self harm where I would cut myself, because I hated myself because I feel unlovable. I find myself unattractive, overweight, uninteresting with no interesting hobbies or skills, and the self harm got progressively worse.  


Now I've had to come back to Pakistan because I was thinking about suicide there in Germany living alone, and also, even tried to, but couldn't because of the pain. I've booked an appointment with a psychiatrist already and it's like 5 days away, but I'm feeling lonely and in pain. And she's in the same discord group as me, so a place that should've been a safe space for me, is not. Plus, she and a very old friend of mine have gotten close so it has strained my friendship with him as well, effectively it seems over. Because they know that them being there, drives me insane literally, and they still actively just sit in group together, even though they can sit on private call as well.  


I later found out that even when we did sit together on vc, or talked in DMs, she acted nice but would later make fun of me behind my back to the others in the group and say how my behavior was disgusting meanwhile she would act all nice infront of me.

696,i cant stop self harming,"i have done this since i was 10 years old and i remember the very first time i ever did it. i remember the instant relief and control and sense of calm that washed over me. i dont even think i understood what i was doing, but i immediately knew this would be the thing i would do for the rest of my life. now im 22. and i still do this thing that i was supposed to have grown out of years ago. and now when i do it, i cant understand a reason to stop. the only thing that ever stopped me before was punishment from my parents. but now im an adult and am supposedly in control of my life. my girlfriend might look at me strange. she might even break up with me over it. but secretly i hope she does because it will confirm that im too awful for her just as i'd believed. and then, even more secretly, i think about how i will be free to hurt myself as much as i like without needing to hide it or make excuses anymore. i can hurt myself until my skin is unrecognizable and maybe i will become a different person. that thought excites me, as sick as it is. i love my girlfriend but i cant stop this pattern of behavior for her. so ill keep lying and hurting myself in ways that i can excuse, until shes found me out and knows how awful i really am. 

i participate in almost every form of hurting there is. i cut myself, burn myself, hit myself until im black and blue and cant even stand up straight anymore. i hit myself so hard once i damaged a nerve and it still hurts months later. and as sick as it is, i love that fact. i dont know what to do because i know its something im not supposed to do. ive gotten in trouble and been scolded and offered other coping skills millions of times throughout my life. ive gone a year or two without it, because people tell me its bad and i shouldn't, but i always come back to it. i just cant see any reason not to. it hurts no one but me, and its the one coping mechanism that has worked all my life. the one thing that makes my body feel like its my own. so many times in my life my body has been stripped of its autonomy, the countless times where it seemed it belonged to everyone but me. this gives it all back to me, even for a moment. so why should i stop that at all? why is it so bad to everyone else but me?",1b25z38,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b25z38/i_cant_stop_self_harming/

I said loudly in English, ""what did you say?!"" After that, the same boy who was talking bad started being super nice to me after. I think he realized that I spoke English.

711,Hi.,"I've been wanting to make a post for so long but never did cause either I don't think people will care so why, I don't know how to write it, end of the day I never write about it for the same reasons I'm depressed. Lack of action. But you know what fuck it.

Backstory: I've been depressed all of my life, sounds like a stretch but let me explain, my family is broken and at the time of birth we were struggling financially and in Nigeria so extra stress, I went through my youth wishing for sleep and death, also religiously I grew up chaotic (a bit of backstory as well here my dad was traditionalist:idol worshipping and stuff then turned Catholic then muslim I guess there's more to unpack here than I ever thought about but not to get off topic), in our household we weren't really religious but my mom still forced the mentality on us so we'd basically bounce from church to mosque to a shrine or whatever, so that fucked me up or liberated me depends on how you think about it. 

Anyway family is kinda fucked and I was plugged into it, I imbibed everything I heard from my mom and still do which as a child fucked me up because she hated my dad, he has his issues, she was the breadwinner of the family and always called him out about it and never hid it in fact she urged me to mentally manipulate him by going to ask for funds like school fees when we both knew he couldn't provide it and when I refused she'd get mad. Don't get me wrong she's still my mom but here's why I don't trust anyone and in extension anything. 

At the youngest age, I believed in nothing, my parents lied, so I did too, religion was only for show to me cause how would I worship different gods and not be punished, I had no role models cause everyone I knew was an extension of my mother and they were also failed people. So gods are fucked, humans are fucked, what isn't fucked.

This is long and you might be bored so I'd summarise (i didn't summarise I'm sorry), I was intelligent and good looking and also depressed or something along the lines (never actually been diagnosed cause I've never complained about depression until this day) I had ""friends"" but they weren't really, I didn't really care about them and didn't bother when they didn't care about me, I deep down have always wanted to die but haven't committed suicide for 2 reasons, one is I truly believe in a God and don't think suicide will be pleasing to him thanks Islam, 2nd is my mom, I actually pity her, she's always worked and provided for us, she got it rough and I just want to succeed cause of her.

Relationships are weird, I've had about 6 or 7 (if you count my experiment being bi) relationships but I never asked them out, they were the ones who asked me and they're all good looking, they literally fell on my lap and i converted it. I have a decent personality, I find it easy to digest things at surface level and cross between topics, thanks to genetics and early years of struggle I'm athletic so the girls come to me easy but I don't actually want to live so I don't grow any of these relationships, i don't know any birthdays and often forget mine, I've broken up with all of them, long story short I'm passively killing myself but some things out of my control lead me to growth and success. 

I'm 27 this year, pretty good job, pretty fit, good looking, healthy, if I was in a crowd you wouldn't know I'm exhausted, suicidal(daily thoughts no action), my siblings are exhausted, my parents are exhausted, I don't actually see a point to life but if we're all gonna die I don't see a point killing myself it's weird. 

Only thing I want is a child and a family, but I'm terrified I'm not worthy of one cause how can someone like me have such a thing. Genuine pure connections.

I'm using this post to vent, idc if no one cares (lie), the world is still gonna spin, I'm not trying to be a victim so this doesn't appeal to me. I hope everyone struggling finds someone willing to struggle with them they can actually trust and love and I hope they're open to it and it goes perfectly. if anything in life every human being deserves a partner that gets them no matter how fucked up you are there are 8 billion people on this earth ffs all i want is 1 that gets me.

Fuck this is long, happy reading and I hope it made sense. Good luck and godspeed.",1b24clt,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b24clt/hi/
712,Correct dosage for sertraline?,"My mom has been having paranoid delusions for the last 2 weeks. She was given 25 mg sertraline for the anxiety by her primary care doctor. Convincing her to take anything at all has been war because in her mind she really is being chased by the FBI, and we are trying to drug her. Yes we have been to the psych wing of the ER. No they can’t hold her there because she doesn’t show signs of harming herself. I tried to get her to see a psych online but she is extremely paranoid of being recorded so only yesterday could  I get an appt in person. She was diagnosed with psychotic depression. This is what the doc prescribed:
100 mg sertraline
10 mg olanzapine 
.4 mg alprazolam

I’m worried that we are increasing dosage to quickly especially on sertraline ( been on 25 mg for 2 weeks) I agree antipsychotics are necessary and sertraline alone won’t do anything and I also understand her current dosage is too low to do anything.

But then I moved to this country I wanted to move out always but not this country and I wanted to go graduation, but I did not have enough and my country's conditions were bad and I moved with my mom.We had a good relation when we moved but now she's mostly complaining and we are arguing like we were before COVID I am not able to make friends again and suffering with religion too.

716,Loosing my edge. ,"Hi sorry for length and grammar, english in not my native language. 
I don't know what I'm looking for here, either advice, kind words or just get this off my chest. I'm 23 years old male currently on uni. I was all my life that one depressed fat nerd in your class. This went with me from elementary, high-school up to uni. Corona year was my first year at uni, and it went really bad with me I got more depressed, fatter and I tryed to kill myself during that time. First semester after corona I didn't even wanted to stay in uni. Things were bad for me bud somehow I prevailed. Things were going up and down in some time I got better lost weight, got rid of most part of my depression. I thought that things can be better got some new friends, started going out etc. This went for little less that 2 years. For a past few weeks I started to more and more self-doubt myself again. I realised from listening to my so called friends that I missed a big portion of my life in depression and anxiety. All of them have something they are good at if it's a sport or hobby or something they can show to impress people around them. All of them did very interesting, funny or cool things. They spend more time together without me and I fallen out from inner circle. They are good at communicating with girls and can choose which one they can be with and which one they don't like. And there is me realising that after two years of recovering from past I have nothing to show no talent nothing to good at, can't loose weight even if I exercise a lot(bc I'm scared of ""voice"" in my head). Can't talk to girls bc I think that I don't have any value to show and I think about myself that I'm so ugly that won't be interested to talking with me. Lost all my time of poberty in depression, developing nothing. I'm just need to write this here, bc I have nobody to talk to about these things. I don't want to go bact to that dark part of my mind where I was couple years ago, I'm scared that if I do I will not have the power to leave from there again. 
 There is maybe more things to this bud some of them are minor or I will remember them later.

 I try to insert myself into groups and seeing them so comfortable and close with each other just makes me feel worse. There's this guy in it that I have a massive crush on. I'd be happy enough to be good friends but he just ignored my text and I guess we'll have to stay as acquaintances. Not that I thought I was as cool and funny as him or his friends but I didn't need another slap in the face saying I'm not good enough. 

I sleep 11 hours a day and when I get up I'm too tired or unmotivated to study. When I'm out with them I drink way more to loosen up and I know he drinks alone sometimes so somehow I'm trying to impress him hoping he'd ask me to drink with him someday.

723,Body confident after a period of emotional hell?,"I went through hell last year. A lot of it I don't really remember (probably a trauma response based on past experiences.) I went days without food or sleep. I had no money because my parents took a lot of it from.me. I went through so many things that nobody should have to. It is what it is. I only survived because I went to college. 

I weighed 200 back in June. I weigh 154 now. I went to the doctor because there could be a ton of different causes. All the tests came back normal. The bilirubin and thyroid were elevated but they have stabilized. The only thing is that my ribcage is exposed. I showed someone a picture of me back in June. They asked me who that was because I look completely different than I do now. 

In no way am I trying to downplay the affects of depression. I actually kind of feel guilty because I know that some people work really hard to lose weight and I achieved it without doing anything. 

Side notes: My parents told me that I looked healthy weight wise. When we saw each other during Christmas I told them I didn't want them bringing up my weight because I didn't really like the way achieved it. 

I think I unintentionally did an intermittent fasting but I don't know.

As of right now I'm doing a lot better mentally than I was last year.

724,Medication isn't doing anything and I'm hopeless,"I just feel so hopeless.
The doctors don't really know what even is wrong with me, is it depression, anxiety, adhd, ASD, a mix of some or all, or plus anything else? don't know and they also say they don't know until I react to medicine.

Last October I started escitalopram, I guess it reduced anxiety but other than that I stayed the same, then in January they added Bupropion, it was giving me a lot of anxiety so then they added Mirtazapine to counter it but basically I just have the same amount of anxiety that I had before escitalopram.
So basically now I'm on 3 different antidepressants and I feel the same as I felt before October, the same I've felt for a decade, I'm 24 and it was only last year that I was able to make myself go see a psychiatrist

I'm losing hope in medication, and I'm losing hope I will ever know what is wrong with me.
I live with my gf, when she isn't home I can't even cook just for myself. I can't wash the dishes, can barely take a shower with a lot of effort, almost never wash my teeth, leaving the bed is hard, I couldn't focus on college plus it was making me so anxious that I dropped out out of the blue after started crying in the classroom, I just cant do anything, I don't want to do anything, and even when I want its really hard.

I seriously don't know how other other people are able to have a college life like in the movies. It's either they're good at hiding their problems, they have a few problems/minor problems, or they know how to cope with the stress.

As for myself, I can't help but feel depressed about college and what the future semesters and school years will look like. I get anxiety because, while we definitely learn a lot, the requirements and submissions can really stress anyone out when in reality, I feel like I can learn these things without having to work with a group or make a video presentation on x and y. It's crazy. 

I really really do work hard. Hell, I once got the highest grade in my class. However, I feel like my priorities and goals have shifted and I want to chase things outside of university. College has made me feel so depressed and suicidal several times in my life. I remember looking at the buildings of our campus and figuring out which buildings are tall enough for me to jump off of.

727,am I suicidal,"for context, I am a college student and I believe I am suffering from moderate depression based on my symptoms, which also run very heavily in my family. I am actively seeking to gain a diagnosis right now.

I often think about killing myself, but I never truly consider it. I just think about the circumstances of how people would react to my death. it has been so hard for me to get out of bed in the mornings, that to me, sleeping is like romanticizing with death and I think about what it would be like to sleep and never wake up.

sometimes when I sit on the roof of my apartment complex, I look over the edge and think about what it would be like to jump.

&#x200B;

the thing is, I consider all these scenarios in my head, but I never truly have the intent to do anything so extreme. It's like my mind is subconsciously flirting with the thought of death in a really weird masochistic way, but I never would truly consider it. I think about those around me and love them too much to ever hurt them like that.

736,I’m struggling,"I’m struggling lately because I feel so lost. I feel so disconnected from everything and everyone. Most of my close friends live across the world, are too busy for me, or both. I’m more alone now than I’ve ever felt in my entire life, and I’m having a horrible time trying to survive. I’ve tried dating apps just to meet people, but literally everyone I message just stops replying after a day. The very few times it doesn’t happen, it goes nowhere, and I just start losing all motivation to even leave my room. 
The few things in life I enjoy doing im not even good at. It makes me feel like putting effort into things is a waste because everything I put time into just falls apart turning out to just be a big waste of time. Anytime my friends and I play competitive games, I lose pretty much every time. It’s so frustrating because I have loads of fun in the moment, but then I second guess every move I make and hate myself immensely for not being able to improve. 
I’ve tried applying for jobs but no one’s called me back. They’re not even fancy jobs they’re just barista type gigs, or thrift shop jobs. 
Currently, I have no one in my life I can talk to about my struggles. No one that will listen without judgement or trying to solve my struggles, and therapy is just too expensive. 
Lately my sleep schedule has been so garbage. Some days I get into bed at 3 in the morning before passing out, and other days I sleep through the day or night just to kill time.
I have no planned future. When I was in junior high nearly 10 years ago now, I decided that I wouldn’t have a future, so I’d just off myself when I felt I was ready. I planned so because with the political situations rising constantly, the world at war constantly, global warming, that there just would be no future for me to live for. To me school or a career path just looked like a waste of time. My goal was to survive long enough to travel. Now that I’ve succeeded in my task I feel like I have no purpose. If I’m being honest I don’t feel like my mindset has change much since then either.
But even if I did focus on a career path, I feel like there’s nothing I’m good at. One of my worst traits is that I’m incredible at doing something on my first try, but immediately wash up and become as mediocre as humanly possible. I just want to have one talent that I feel confident could turn into a career. One single thing that I could use as a reason to want a future. 
I’ve just struggled for so long to see any bigger picture. I guess if I have any question or advice to look for, I would ask what people do to deal with crippling depression. How do I motivate myself to care about having a future when I can’t even imagine a future for my kid if I were to have one.

Well my anxiety caused me to choke during the interview, I shut down, I fumbled something I should have nailed in retrospect. So I must go back home. The country in question is changing their visa rules effectively cutting me off moving forward.

741,Misunderstood,"I’m 23, African American boy. My birth wasn’t what most have experienced(hopefully not). Originally I’m the sixth child of a family I never meet nor heard from(Let’s call them Family B).  I found out once I was 8-9 ish. I’ve came to terms with it about 14-15 ish going into high school. I’m grateful to have made it this far into life with no real harm to me. Physically I’m not the strongest but not the weakest. Mentally is a whole different story (I’ll explain later.) I’ve been raised alone as an only child due to my current family(Let’s call them Family A). My parents have gave me all the tools to succeed in life as a person in their eyes. My Mother is from a hidden out town in Texas called Lufkin as the youngest of four and my father is from the country to of Dade City Florida and he’s (to my knowledge is the youngest of his siblings.) I was born in Missouri City, Houston TX. Both my parents were Educators.(If you have or had parents as educators you know for a fact you have no real choice but to have a good act. I’m not a bad person just people don’t take time to learn about me.) My father was a PE teacher All through my life in Elementary. He even made the decision to hold me back a year so I can be around the same age group of kids so I can make friends.(The reason that was is because of my Birthday. I was born later in life. Lemme explain in better terms. Imagine the youngest and smallest kid in the room who had no business being there.) Anyway growing up I was always known as “Coach Jones Son/ Boy”  Due to the fact my father being at the school for 30 or so years. He full retired from school teachings in 2019 the same year I graduated High School. Remembering back to wat I can remember I was always my father’s shadow for how he was the best teacher known in that district. He taught former students kids, former city figures and more. My father also had a lawn care service with him me and my mother. (We didn’t have much but we made something outta nothing.) All through those years I honestly never learned anything. I’m not dumb nor a slacker. I just didn’t see how any of it could help me in life and that mentality stayed with me till now in fact. I grew up around preppy white kids and rare but uncommon rich ppl. The school was diverse but majority White American. About 75 close to 80%. So I didn’t really have much close friends to make beside my friends in my neighborhood( Who were black lol). I didn’t rlly start going to a dominant black school until I started middle school and high school and holy fuck it was worse. No let’s dive back into why mentally I’m not comfortable with anything. When I found out I was adopted I didn’t make much of it. I didn’t know what it meant. My mom said I was blessed, but I rather think I was a burden. Just a reusable, like thrift store clothes or an empty water bottle. Once my so called friends made jokes, always said shit  “my opinion didn’t” or “Imagine being a reject”. Till this day I can never stop hearing ppl say that. Middle school was were I honestly thought I’d kill my self for the fact I didn’t know how to be an actual person. You know, express myself in a positive way to grow as a whole you know. I just wanted to keep everything in a me only perspective. But it was hard. If you’ve heard the saying “Smile through the pain or See the pain through his eyes” that I AM the living experience. I’ve always been a kind soul through and through. Even if I didn’t cause the issue I was in, I’d try to make it clear there was no foul in anything, but I still felt as if I was the cause. I just always felt like the problem. Since then I’ve felt that that way even right now. Anyway going into high school wasn’t the best but who start is the best anyway. I started at the main school everyone in the area went to which was the closest then changed to a new school that was brand new to the district. So a fresh start for me. But I’ll let you guess how those last three year of high school went? If you said good then you’re wrong. If you said bad the you’re wrong. It was the most FRUSTRATING I’ve been in my life. I never went to a party, never been to a school club. Barley went to socials. I didn’t even evolve educationally. I honestly couldn’t fathom how much others were way above me everything. And what made it worse is that my grades were so bad my family made the school change my learning compared to other students. When big tests were happening I was cut off from classes and separated from friends I’ve made so I can “Improve”. I was basically in jail while in school. The only time I felt free was in athletics which only had my interest because of my dad. My dad back in the day played for the  Oakland A’s and Philadelphia Phillies farm teams and Mexico League as well. I’d played baseball most life because of him. He was happy to see me play when I did. But deep down I knew I wasn’t gonna grow nor gain the talent most others did. So I did the best I can with my body handle. So I played all through high school. I was on varsity all 3 yrs but mostly played as a bench player. Wasn’t happy but I did make my father proud. Wish I can say I could’ve done better in my classes but to be honest I lost complete interest in it. All I knew was hard labor. Since I was put to work cutting lawns for the family with him to put extra money in our pockets. My senior year was prob the scariest of my life for the fact I almost lost my father twice(I’ll save for another story time). After graduating( barely) I took a yr off school to make money and focus on what I wanted to do.  I decided to go to community college just to see if I can even get a degree. I got my Associate degree in Dec 2021.( If you remember how bad the world was during the time then you know how tough that was during quarantine). That time drove me into a spiraling state of depression that even friends to this day will always remember. My life is my prison. I didn’t chose it I was brought into it. All gas no breaks. I still live with my family after some finacial decisions have changed my path.  Some say I should have an easy life. You know a college a diploma, no felonies/bad record, a car and even a good paying job. I’m lost. I see my friends doing their thing and I’m being left behind like I felt being adopted at birth. I just wanna me be normal and happy but these days you gotta pay to be happy but I still at least. 

I don’t know if anyone would read this but please, any older audiences please lend me a bit of your wisdom or advice. It would mean the world to me. 
•On a positive note I make music to help keep my depression and dark thought from rising to help relieve stress like I used to but even that isn’t enough. I wanna make clothes, I wanna make music with my friends who have had my back. But my family treat my ideas as things that won’t help me survive on my own. And we all know time won’t stop for no one.

You’d think “hey, she has a good life” but that doesn’t stop my mind from wandering and thinking of a million little things to knock me down. Depression really has a hold on me, I’ve never actually spoke to anybody about it and I’m sure that’s why it’s gotten worse. I find myself crying almost every other day for any little thing. It stays bottled up (I don’t recommend btw). I gave myself this little gift (tattoo). It’s small and simple, but means so much. I haven’t attempted suicide and I don’t think I ever would. Because I’m scared. I’ve had the thoughts. Ive planned it in my head a couple of times. I know I would never be able to go through with it though. I have kids. I can’t leave them motherless.

Last year I (25m) got a divorce from my wife (24f). We were highschool sweethearts and moved in together after. To make a long story short, there mistakes made by myself primarily, but she made her fair share and it came back to haunt out marriage. We ended up agreeing to divorce since we knew it wasn't going to work out anymore.

Well, it's been about a year since then and naturally, I was depressed as hell at first, I loved that girl beyond words. But, as divorces go, those feelings are VERY gone now. 

I met someone and had an fwb for a few months after and it helped alot with realizing things were going to get better. I felt like there was hope. We started to catch feelings for each other and I had to back away. Idk why I did but I got scared I guess.

Now I've been truly single again for a few months, and it's like I'm back to square one. I have NO sex drive, I can't sleep some nights, and im just mentally exhausted 24/7. I keep thinking of my ex wife and how good the good times were, and how much I miss having a PARTNER in life.

759,Struggling with Depression: My Experience Seeking Help in Germany,"Hey guys, I'm from Germany, so forgive me if my English isn't perfect.

I'm 26 now and I've been suffering from depression for several years. The thoughts have been getting worse to the point where I didn't care about what would happen to my girlfriend and family if I took my own life. In November, I finally found the courage to talk to the doctor about it, which was really difficult for me. My general practitioner then referred me to a day clinic where I got an appointment on February 26, 2024. It took a lot of effort for me to bring it up at the day clinic, as I'm very reserved and I don't want to bother anyone with my problem because everyone has their own problems. But I did talk about it and was well received. They gave me the medication quetiapine and I also felt comfortable. The next day was my first therapy session and I was also ready for group and individual sessions, after all, I had decided to seek treatment on my own.

I don't know how it is in other countries, but in Germany, in a day clinic, you get an individual plan tailored to you, which includes things like group therapy at 9:00 a.m., pottery at 11:00 a.m., etc. I told the doctor that I didn't feel ready to do occupational therapy or pottery. I also said that if I made any pottery there, I would just throw it away at home because I don't need it, it would be a waste of resources, and I don't see how it would help me. Besides, my pottery would always remind me of the lowest point in my life. But my doctor wasn't understanding at all and said, ""I wouldn't confront my fears."" Even though I would participate in all the conversations. He also gave the example (I work as a retail salesman at Kaufland) and said, ""It's like if I say I won't go to Kaufland because it's not a supermarket."" I thought the comparison was so stupid; he's a psychologist who works with depressed people and compares pottery with a shop he won't shop at... The doctor then discharged me directly from the day clinic and said I was banned from there. I honestly find it so stupid that on the one hand they say they'll take care of you so you'll get better, but on the other hand, you're left alone with your problem because you don't want to do pottery, even though there could be other activities during that time...

Now I went to my general practitioner to ask for a psychologist to talk to, but the doctor wasn't there and I talked to the assistant at the reception... Privacy was completely top again... She said it's impossible to get a psychologist and I should try again at the day clinic... I feel so abandoned as if none of the non-depressed people understand me. I'm also too proud to go back to the day clinic if I've been told by a doctor the day before that I'm the problem and I'm closing myself off from everything even though I just want to talk... I don't want to do crafts or sports, I want to talk...

I finally decided to put up boundaries to take care of myself and start looking out for myself, to end that cycle of neglection that has destroyed my mental health. These boundaries were simple, I wanted some more time to myself at night and she took this as I was trying to get away from her and break up with her so that's what she told our friends.

ive tried reflecting on myself, and i don’t think i even really know who i am anymore. i don’t know my favourite colour. i couldn’t tell you my favourite food or movie, or my dislikes. i do not know. im not sure when i stopped knowing.

i don’t know what to do. life feels so wrong, i just wake up everyday and wait for it to be night again. i go to school to see my friends smile. i can’t think of anything else. i used to finish a book in 3 days, haven’t picked one up in weeks. i don’t want to watch a show, i don’t want to talk to anybody. i don’t want to do anything. 

i have a history with mental health, but i can’t remember those times much. i remember getting sent to a hospital when i was 9 for suicidal thoughts, but those memories don’t feel as real as now. this feels very different. i promised myself i would never be suicidal again because i saw how sad it made everyone around me, and im not suicidal now. sometimes, though, i wonder what would happened if i did die. i don’t want to kill myself but i can’t imagine myself in the future. it’s weird. 

anyways, thanks for reading if you got this far. i just needed to get some things off my chest because nobody around me needs to know this. i don’t know if im depressed or just in a bad mood, but i don’t think it matters. we’re all going through something over here lol.",1b1t2id,5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b1t2id/i_feel_numb_14f/
770,I'm super morbidly obese and am so depressed than I'm not eating.,"I had half of a single-serving yogurt cup this morning and 12 hours later ordered a pizza to see if that helped.  I ate one slice.  Being so overweight (previously almost 200 lbs over my ideal weight), it doesn't take much thought to figure out that eating is my favorite thing to do.  It's a very addictive hobby.  And I usually love to cook and try new recipes!

I'm losing weight like crazy.  Which is awesome!  But this is not the way I want to do it...  I have no appetite and, thus, no energy from not eating.  The good thing is that I'm not dealing with the urge to cut/sh like I normally would when depressed.  I think this is why it snuck up on me.

I am going to take my first shower in almost two weeks as soon as I post this.  Ugh...  I could really use someone to talk to one-on-one.  I am so lonely.  I have no friends and my closest family is an hour away.  I can't drive.

772,Emotionally exhausted ,"I hope someone here can relate to what I’m going through here. Had a melt down tonight and I just want to put it all out there and hold myself accountable to move forward.

I’m in my early 30’s, been at the edge several times since my teens, and only got diagnosed with depression in my mid twenties. 

Have struggled throughout my adult life, to find doctors in California work with me on the medication front. No issues with behavioral therapy at least, although I do go out of network for that, and I love my therapist. 

I’ve been subscribed sub-clinical doses of multiple meds at different times, or given straight up wrong information. For example: take mirtazapene in the morning (making me a sleepy and irritable). Only now am I on 150 mg of Effexor (after being on 32 for entirely too long), but I’m always hot and sweaty, headachy and my GI tract is not happy. When I complain about the side affects, my doctor (Kaiser Permanente) blames periods and is reluctant to do anything because I’m not suicidal.

Throughout this, I’ve built a solid career as an environmental engineer over the last decade. The wrinkle is that my role as a CUPA/CA county haz mat inspector, uses all of my social battery. I do my best to put facilities at ease, display that even though I’m a young woman, I know how industry works (from being a hands on consultant, working at the dreaded tesla factory and a DOE/govt research lab) and be funny and kind. 

After a 10 hour day inspecting 2-3 facilities (yeah we do 4-10’s and I’m not thrilled) I’m beat. Like non-verbal beat. 

To give an example, after a long day at a networking conference, I had to rush down to photograph my boyfriend at work as this is his last season working for an NHL hockey franchise. I awkwardly rushed to my seat in between plays and bumped some people’s legs when they didn’t stand up. I thought I asked to get to my seat and waited a sec seconds, but this group disagreed. One of women made a sharp remark to me sending me back to being that quiet bullied kid in 2nd grade. Another woman criticized me while I was still crying. I think I deserved grace, but hey, this isn’t about them.

I know I need to keep fighting the medical establishment to get meds that actually work. 

Probably switch to a 5 day schedule so I’m not so dead and can make more time for my hobbies and friends. Thankful to have a handful of wonderful friends (and fur babies) that I can be real with, but oh man, shit is still hard.

Hope this wasn’t too rambly, and that you know you’re not alone.

774,"I feel like i need someone to talk to, without judging.","I felt like life has led me to a rather worn down road, with bodies all around me, surrounding me, suffocating each breath that I take. It has come to the point where I feel I cant breathe. I can’t think right. I just need a breather. A safe space that I can call home. A space where all things, including the people closest to me, will disappear just for a brief moment. I just felt like I needed that serenity, that calm and that peace. Where I can be myself. Looking out into the distance, enjoying the scintillating stars in space, floating around Saturn’s rings, walking around a volcano. 

Im writing this to express how I feel about my life. Im being controlled and used. And I have no one else to talk to about it that wont judge me. I have no best friends because of my attitude. Im alone. But to me, being alone is a dream. And that dream will be actualized in a few more days when the person closest to me will go to her workplace. I feel happy, I feel blissful that I don’t have to pretend anymore. Im tired of pretending you know? 

I love her, but… its different. Its like im loving an entirely different person 3 years go. Not the person that I used to know. I preferred the previous one. The one that loved me for who I am, without concerns about my money. The one who talked to me without judging. The one who actually respected me as a man. I feel broken, I feel pathetic, I feel sad. I just want to be loved for who I am. Without pretending. I feel like I lost all my confidence and my pride.

775,"It's definitely gone. The last option and hope to vent and be understood died before my eyes. (Just antother Vent here, TLDR: fuck inhuman people)","In my 20s, man.

I've been dealing with this mental illness since the end of 2k19.

I've never been able to tell anyone about the suicidal thoughts and fucked up ideas, ideas that run through my mind permanently in a constant loop.

The closest I came to talking about this was in one of those tortuous, peaceful endless early mornings.I had this empty idiot face and my mom found me staring at the wall for 20 minutes straight until I finally realized she was there.

It took her 2 years to realize I was sick, and when she confronted me about it, her reaction was a ""meh, ok"".

And from that reaction, I instantly understood that I was already screwed.

My family is that ""type"" of family.
That family where they manage to be totally ignorant stupid in the sense of understanding the importance of mental health.

They believe and summarize that having this disease is just ""being a little sad."" Ignoring and unaware of everything else that comes the fact of this sicknes.

I thought maybe they could understand it in the long run, I was wrong, very wrong.

When I saw that it was foolishly useless to even try to express myself, I instantly dismissed it. I did it out of fear, difficulty, and total reluctance.

And so the years went by, suffering and having a hard time almost permanently. I live in a constant dispute with my mother and older brother, always angry with me for the permanent disinterest and for how absolutely unproductive I am.

Even I don't know how I continue to survive the constant and heavy episodes. Day by day, everything is even worse and I'm reaching the last extremes. Not many weeks ago, I took a knife from the kitchen, it was almost unsharpened. And since I was always a complete coward, I didn't dare to touch my veins, instead, I cut off my upper arm, as if from a small attack of cat's claws.

I felt like a monster, not because of what I did, but because it calmed me down, and I even laughed a little at how pathetic it all was.

Obviously, the outages didn't close overnight.

My mother discovered them at a lunch and accused me about this, I managed to evade the truth by saying that I made them while repairing the metal curtain in the house.

She barely believed it and said, ""I don't want you to be like your aunt.""She never talks about her, the only thing I knew, was that she died in a motorcycle accident along with her partner.

Turns out I found out that my aunt had active suicide attempts. Sometimes trying to throw themselves under the wheels of cars, sometimes playing Russian roulette, sometimes cutting themselves more deadly.

And in those anecdotes she told me as I listened with my stupid face, I finally accepted the truth. The truth is that I'm never going to be on the same page as them. The truth is that they will never understand me, and most importantly.

They're never going to take me seriously.

My mother called my aunt ""someone who did all of that to get simply attention.""

They didn't give a fuck when my aunt called for help in that way.

 So, what's left for me?

How do I make aware this mental problema to people that sees suicide as a fucking joke?


What I can do? Am I really going to spend the last 2/4 years of my useless life so lonely and disconnected from everything? I've fought silently for too many years, and this is how it all ends?... 

Do you know what is the funniest thing? that I really love these idiots called ""family"" with everything I have left in my soul. They are the only thing I have, and while I know how extremely toxic and damaging this is, they are the only thing I still care about in this disgusting, insensitive society and world.

I just can't get to the end point. As much as I long for suicide every day of my life, I don't want to be that selfish. I want to at least die after my mother. I don't want her to suffer. I don't want it, despite all the permanent damage she does to me without realizing it, Mom, I love you with the little I still have

 If you made it this far, simply thank you for reading. I think it's better to talk to strangers about this than to keep all of this in my damaged, disgusting brain.

776,Light.,"Im not sure exactly when I became “depressed.” All my life I have been more or less optimistic and always have had a better perspective of the world (Glass half full.) After a few setbacks due to “self sabotage,”etc. I never knew how disgusting it could feel to be alive. The pain was indescribable at most. For the majority of the time I could barely explain how I felt to a therapist because I couldn’t even comprehend it myself. I was left dumbfounded at my own dilemma since I could usually overcome batches of depression with a tint of my naturally made optimism and what not. Yet, this merciless monster would not leave my domain. I would have inclinations of hope, but after a while they would dissipate after my own would subconsciously remind me that I was alone, lost, and afraid. It was physical almost. I thought maybe I had a tumor in a part of my brain that was keeping me this way. All in all, I knew to a degree. That this was more or less my fault. It has gotten a bit better, but I have a-lot to do to get back to the point where I was before. It hasn’t been easy of course. Especially considering that I foresaw no chance of ever feeling as “happy” as I was a few years ago. I thought the sea of black sludge would always be around me til the day I died. There was a life before and after my depression. This is the farthest id gone hopefully for my entire life. I just turned 23 yesterday and after a few sequences of self reflection. I am in a state of coming to terms with my disability as a reminder of what happens when you do not stay true to yourself. I have suffered this long and now it is true. Maybe in a few years I will look back at this period with gratitude. Though, one thing I never lost during and this period was my dignity and treating others kindly. Even if I saw no point in human life at one point. Im done being the greatest pessimist west of the Mississippi. Im ready to live my life eagerly again. Waiting for the truth of the world to strike me once more. For I will rise again and again as I have before.",1b21wc5,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b21wc5/light/

785,I don’t know how to handle this anymore,"For a bit of context I (13F) live with my sister (15) , mom (40) dad (47), and grandma (69) on a farm. My dad is a narcissist and emotionally immature, my mother is emotionally absent, my grandma is a stoner and a drunk, and my sister is well a normal sister, we bicker and fight a lot like normal siblings. I do online school and go to public school for electives (yearbook and weights) Tuesday through Friday and go to a tutor on Wednesdays

Since I live on a farm ( mind you it’s pretty small, we have about 30-40 chickens, 5 ducks, 3 dogs, and a cat ) which is about 35 acres, my mom runs a farmstand and we are working on an airBNB. I am pretty busy throughout the day, chores and school occupying most of my time. I have around 10 routinely chores a day along with extra chores that I get a random times ( these extra chores can be from 1 hour to 12+ hours )

I am expected to finish all of my schoolwork and chores before I go to school for electives ( 12:45-2:40 ) and if I don’t I will get my phone and all electronics taken away.

I do most of not everything that is asked of me, have straight A’s, do my absolute best to turn in all my work on time and generally try to stay out of peoples way to avoid be a problem.

If I hear footsteps I hide whatever I’m doing (reading most of the time, watching a show, on my phone) ( even if I finished all my chores ) and pretend to be doing something more ‘productive’ ex. Cleaning my room, doing schoolwork etc.

I have free time but it can be taken away at any moment, I never know when my dad will be in one of his ‘moods’ and get mad at me. So I play it safe and keep to my room.

I barely have enough motivation to get up, all I wanna do is stay in bed, all I wanna do is nothing. I can’t do schoolwork unless I force myself to and usually I end up getting mentally and emotionally exhausted from even attempting my work. 

In my dads words ‘chores are more important than school’ I have to get up at 8:30 which is a huge struggle due to me having no free time without the fear of it being taken away in an instant, I don’t sleep until my eyelids are so heavy I cannot physically keep them open anymore (12-6am) I am also not allowed to take naps or go to friends houses/even out of the house sometimes if my school is not done.

The only comfort I have is shows and books that I have an emotional connection with, wether it be a character that had had similar experiences as me or another reason, it can be taken from me in an instant.

I try to stay out of people way, don’t ask for anything, don’t ask for help, just do it myself. I don’t wanna ask questions or ask for things I don’t need. I don’t wanna be a bother or upset anyone ( mostly my dad, he yells a lot ) so I avoid asking for things if I can do it myself.

What I said is barely even surface level of things that go on, I barely mentioned anything. I know most of you will probably think I’m being a dramatic middle school kid, but it’s more than that, way , way, more.

786,I cant take the fact that my father doesn’t accept my transition.,"
Me (20) and my father (54) live together in an apartment. He does not support my transition and it hurts so much. I’ve been transitioning for around 16 months now and he still refuses to use my chosen name and pronouns. Whenever we try to talk about it and I call him out, even in the slightest it always turns into a toxic shouting and bitching fest. The other day he told me he was praying the trans away at church, without even being prompted.

However, ignoring the transgender stuff my father is very supportive and kind to me. He has been like my best friend for my entire life. Hell, the other day he took me to buffalo wild wings because he saw I was sad. Recently he also took me on a road trip just to hang out, and it went great. Lately I have been going through an awful depression/anxiety/ocd episode. He has been helpful by playing Minecraft with me and watching YouTube videos with me. I feel so entitled and selfish to expect him to support my transgender identity.

I am so hurt because I genuinely don’t know what to do in this situation, my father’s toxicity to my transition is destroying me because I feel so freaking guilty for being trans and taking hormones. At the same time I can’t really cut him out of my life because he obviously loves me.

Honestly I’m such a fuck up. Last month I already told him that his (and the rest of the families) lack of support is making me want to detrans. I can’t take this, I’ve already waved the white flag. I’ve already lost. It’s over. I’ve wanted to be a woman my whole life but I need to accept I can’t have it. I’m a burden to my family 

Yes, in case any of you are wondering, yes I am feeling suicidal. I don’t want to tell him though because that seems manipulative and I don’t want to make him feel bad. I feel so greedy and selfish, some people get kicked out of the house or treated like crap by their parents. Meanwhile this is my main issue with him and it’s tearing me apart, ain’t I spoiled.

789,"Depression is slowly consuming me, day by day","Over the last year I have gained 80lbs, I now weigh 337lbs. I've noticed that my breathing is much more shallow, the average person takes 2 seconds to breathe in and 3 seconds to exhale. I take 1 second inhales and 1 1/2 exhales. I was so depressed that I wouldn't even masterbate, for 2 years. I finally found a bit of spark to do so in the last few months and the difference is staggering. For one, my manhood has shrunk almost an entire inch in those 2 years, and now... instead of 9 to 11 minutes of playtime, I can only manage 1 minute or two. Which is very frustrating. I can't imagine what sex would be like... I've tried a couple different approaches but nothing works. 

My blood pressure has risen over 40% in the last year alone. There are times where my arms feel very weak for no reason, it lasts a few minutes and then goes away, but that is something I've never experienced before. It only started happening within the last month. 

I can barely carry a 10lb bag of groceries 3 blocks, which I have to rest for 10-15 minutes afterwards, heavily breathing through my mouth because my nose doesn't inhale enough air. I'm not running the 3 blocks or anything, just walking at a somewhat normal pace.

I can't walk more than 6-7 blocks before my left leg begins to burn and my left ankle begins rotating, acting like it's going to pop out of joint or something. 

A lot of the weight I've gained has gone to my face, particularly my cheeks. This makes my face look malformed and is a tremendous put off to women I try to approach. Most of the rest of my weight has been into my gut, which has grown in size 2 fold in the last year.

793,Post Graduation Depression,"Hi yall, first time posting. I’ve (23f) struggled with depression since I was a teenager. When I was younger, I was so excited for college still. It was all I dreamed of. Moving out, making friends, falling in love, learning. I graduated last year, and while I’m really proud of myself, I don’t know what to do now. I’ve felt depressed since graduating. I don’t know what the point of living is. I work every day and then die. I can’t get a better job, I’ve tried. And the only point of waking up feels like to get money to pay bills. I feel like I have no other milestones left. I stopped doing my hobbies, hanging out with friends makes me mad, on my days off I just rot in bed. I have friends, family, and a wonderful partner, but I feel like I’m just wasting time until I die. Anyway, hopefully one day I can afford therapy or have some sort of epiphany on how people are happy. This was melodramatic. Any advice or stories would be appreciated. Thanks yall.

794,Lost my friend to suicide three days ago,"He was one of the few people who had an impact on my life and understood what I was going through. We both had depression. I often helped him - by talking, coming to his house, giving him list of good psychiatrists and therapists, even arranged a meeting with psychologist a month before his death. I can't forgive myself. I feel like I haven't done enough. None of us noticed the signs, he was going out with friends one day before, talking about his future, loving his new hobby...Maybe I should call an ambulance before? Drag him to the hospital? Give him any stronger meds I had at my house? Everyone is saying that it was his decision and that we should respect it, however, I can't. This shouldn't end like this. 

I am after my own suicide attempt - so I know what he was going through that night. His decision was probably impulsive. Why he decided to do this? Why he didn't call me that night? I was awake. He was only 22 years old, intelligent, good-hearted, sensitive, maybe too sensitive for this world. I simply cannot fathom what's happening. I can't. It's so unfair.

I really need to take a break and focus on my health but I can’t because I have bills to pay. My job offers different types of leave but I won’t get paid enough while I’m on leave to pay my bills and I can’t just keep going on leave everytime I have a flare up or something.

I feel like I’m going to get fired because of how much time I’m taking off and not being able to do my job responsibilities. 

I need a job that doesn’t drain me mentally and physically but also pays enough so I have somewhere to live and transportation to my doctors appointments.

My family won’t let me live with them for free. I would be willing to watch the kids, or do something to contribute. They don’t even believe I’m sick and just think I’m a hypochondriac.

I can’t work but I also can’t not work. So what the fuck am I supposed to do?

My parents have picked up on me being down a little but my friends don't seem to care or notice. All they see is me high 24/7 and they just tell me to stop and that I'm being like my ex boyfriend. Earlier today one of my ex boyfriends who still hangs out in our group said ""we might have to banish you"".

800,Took a MMSE test today.,"Hey all. Normally I’m a pretty upbeat guy. I went through something 4 years ago that I’m still struggling with and today was a part of that. I’m HIV+ and have HIV Associated Neurocognative Disorder because I had encephalitis. It fucks with my memory. Badly. So I took my second MMSE test today, supposed to have one every year but, I, of course, forgot. Heh heh. On brand. The first time I took it I got a 24, cutoff for normal cognitive function. Today I got a 22, which is Mild cognitive impairment or possible early-stage to mild dementia. So I got that goin’ on. But the kick in the nuts is constantly forgetting things and saying I don’t remember, have I told you this already. It makes me feel idiotic and kills my self esteem. Like HIV, there’s no cure for this and it’ll only get worse. The meds I’m on will slow it. I try not to think too much about it but I’m constantly reading about it cause I want to know. I’m the one who asked my infectious disease doctor if I had this. But I’m alive. I’m undetectable. I have a great support system. It’s just some days are worse than others.

808,I don’t know what’s my problem,"Hi  ,English isn’t my native language so it might be hard to understand 
I don’t know how to talk to people that are close to me about this so I thought I can share here , I’m 14 girl yea I know 
 my parents divorced a few months ago, it was really hard on my two brothers (16,8) and still is but me? I didn’t felt anything not sad ,mad, upset i just don’t  know how to feel . I wouldn’t say that I was a help to my younger brother we fought everyday he said so many things to me like “go to dad house and don’t ever comeback ” or “i wish you’d die” I just laugh and make fun of him I know I’m in the wrong here but my mom always took his side and it just made me hate him more she would say things like “why are you doing this to your brother” and “ you really like to make him miserable don’t you “ and my favourite “ put yourself in his shoes “ I don’t get it if I fight with him it means that I want to make him miserable but when he fights with me it’s because he doesn’t know what’s going on and why my parents are not together . I know that it’s true but my mom acts like only my brother is going through that . About my older brother he just can’t understand why they can’t just work it out .
My parents were always fighting and they did try for it to work in the end it didn’t.

 all of  this happened in August I think that now my relationship with my mom and dad is worse me and my dad were closer than me and mom but now I don’t really talk to them also to my brothers the only reason why we don’t fight is because I’m in my room all day . 
It’s random but I can’t remember anything it started a few months ago and now it’s starting to annoy me I can’t remember to do homework, drink, put a clock for the morning and also I’m fucking lazy I don’t clean my room , when I remember to do homework I don’t , I don’t go to school cause I can’t get up in the morning because I go to sleep at 6am and when I don’t go to school I just sleep, on my phone , eat and go to sleep again at 6am it’s a fucking loop everyday
I can’t concentrate at school and because I don’t come like 3 days a week I don’t know anything. I fucking hate everything about myself how are you lazy,stupid, annoying, selfish, spoiled and a crybaby . Everytime my mom tries to talk to me I’m always mad or my dad also I can’t get angry cause if I do it feels like I’m going to cry or if I try to talk about my feelings I feel like someone is choking me and when I just want to tell something that happens to me I get everything mixed up I can’t tell a story without my friends looking at me like I said something crazy 

I can’t think about anything because if I think like “I can’t do this anymore “ my fucking mind is telling me that I only think that because I think someone is listening to me
I actually don’t know if this is real it feels like this is all fake and someone is controlling me or that my life is just an experiment 
I just don’t understand why me I prefer that my life were just sad then to not know what I feel 
I can be sad for a day but all of a sudden nothing happen and im all happy again or that im trying to be feel something I don’t care what but I just sit there and think about nothing 
I really just want to know what’s happening and why am I like this I wish that I could remember what it was like before but I just can’t. 

Well that was sure something do I feel good after writing all of this? I don’t know
Good night now

I have a job that consumes my life, and an apartment that consumes my money, I have another part of my life that does nothing but increase my stress. I drink daily and wish I had the balls to just get lost. Nothing makes me feel happy anymore except seeing my long distance partner. I know I shouldn't prioritize the relationship above all else but when that's the only good thing it's hard not too. I have a therapist but therapy has never worked for me I'm on meds that don't work. Life is just wonderful and Ive come to find out it's not life. I can blame my job, my drinking, my whatever on how bad I feel but you know what for once in my life I feel like the depression is right. This is 1000% on me. Maybe I'm just not cut out to live in the world and be happy at the same time. I have therapy tomorrow and I really don't know what to say anymore maybe we will talk about my parents, or job, or the drinking, or maybe I'm just sad cause my ADHD is bad.

my friends know of what i go through, but they don’t know how intense it is because if i tell them, i know they won’t stick around because i’m dealing with a friend who’s doing it now. my friends say they’ll always be my friends, but i know if i disappear, they won’t care (i’ve tested it and it’s true). watching it in real time and knowing that at the end of the day, it’s my fault sucks.

i grew up fairly “normal” around 12-13 my parents started arguing constantly and eventually divorced around when i was 16

during that period i started to rebel and try drugs and new experiences i fell into a deep depression for around 2-3 years within that same time i had my first sort of relationship also, that relationship had a very messy ending and since then it felt almost like i had pulled myself out of the depressive state, i started working out and exercising, no drugs or alcohol nothing.

i tried another relationship a-bit later and it’s probably not in the best state at the moment, and i feel my anxiety’s and depression coming on again, i now smoke/vape constantly, lost my job and have no motivation to work, pull myself out of bed or exercise, most mornings i wake up i wish i didn’t open my eyes, i feel the strongest feeling of regret and numbness the second my brain knows I’m conscientious,

i feel like I’m starting to question who i am, i feel like decisions i make are highly dependent on what other people think of me

i feel incredibly lost, i don’t know who i am, what i want, what my goals are

since around 12-13 i never saw my life past 20

I’m so deep in my own head i continuously ask my self if I’m bad socially, if I’m controlling, if I’m a narcissist this list goes on

822,My life has not been the same since I left home for college: depression and loneliness,"I was famous in my home country, received many awards for science and mathematics, and represented the country in the math Olympics internationally (IMO), it was a dream to study abroad, I got the royal scholarship, came to the States, and BOOM: my life has not been the same since I left home for college. 

Oh. My. God. I just do not know how to start and where to start from. It has been numerous days when I did not want, or couldn't, leave my bed. Everything turned dark, gradually, and I observed myself sinking and sinking. While doing so, I was TOO embarrassed to ask for help because of how high everyone who knows me thinks of me. 

I started missing deadlines, failing classes because I would not show up to midterms or finals or do anything, procrastinating, sleeping too much or sleeping too little, and spending too much time in my head thinking thinking thinking about EVERY little thing and every single thing. 

I hate the way I look yet many people say I am handsome and pretty. I hate the way I am different yet everyone I meet has admired something about me. But, there is this feeling in me that is just telling me: Oh you are not good enough. You are nothing. 

I hate this voice. I hate its echo that resonates with various frequencies periodically in my thoughts. I made mistakes yes, but how can I fathom all of this that has happened to me: 

A. My beloved brother experienced mental illness during my first year of college, it had gotten to the point where he was going to kill me in two instances, one while he was driving, and the other by a knife. We grew up together, we were together in every single thing that we did.. 

B. I got into a toxic relationship, where the guy was cheating on me for years, yet I was so into him because I was too appreciative and grateful for finally being able to practice my true sexual orientation (homosexuality is prohibited in my country)

C. With A and B going on and on and on: I decided to claim asylum in the States (due to sexual orientation), and I think I made the biggest mistake of my life. I am a family guy. I grew up around and being surrounded by them. My family has been my biggest support system, and the only one. I have not seen them in 3 years and a half. But what can I do? I wanted to be free. 

Loneliness. Loneliness. Loneliness. 

I have had big dreams, and I am slowly chasing them, but man! this is well above what I can take. I feel like I have hit rock bottom and I am unable to get back up. The depression is eating me away. I just always feel like I am in my head with my thoughts, always feel like life is dark and nothing matters anymore.

824,It's just too much + finding help in Denmark?,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to vent, and maybe find any advice... TLDR at the  bottom

My mental health is just getting worse and worse recently and I feel like I am out of options... 

I moved to Denmark nearly 6 years ago, hoping to start new life, but things just keep getting worse. The official reason for my moving were my studies, but I had so many more reasons to escape from my home country, Poland. Of course my studies went horribly wrong. I had to redo a semester because of my depression, and afterwards I couldnt find any job related to my studies. I was left with massive student debt - the way it works in Denmark is that you get grant if you are studying but you also have to work 42 hours a month. And since I was studying during covid, all the student work places - bars, cafes, hotels, etc. were shut down immediately. I got a letter from the goverment saying i have to pay back pretty much all the student grant I got. I asked them where the hell was I supposed to work if everything was closed, they didnt care. And there was no way for me to set the amount I was paying back each month, and it ended up being nearly 1/3 of my salary. Every month. For 2 years. I was barely survivng, not going to any concerts, selling some of my instruments, dumpster diving to find food, and I am stuck living in place that's cheap, but super filthy. 

My studies lead me nowhere, since last year they shut down pretty much all study programms in English, and my degree in worth only half of a bachelor, so I cannot even do masters with it, and my Danish isnt nowhere near good enough to study in it.  

I still have no idea what I want to do in the future. I am 28 by the way. My life in Poland was really bad as well, I had to collect scrap metal and do black work to save up enough money to move out, since it was hard to find ""real"" job in my hometown. My parents are quite poor themselves, and I would feel like shit if I had to ask them for money. 

This winter was particularly awful for me... in the summer I have quite a steady job, but outside of that I work at the trash sorting place that doesnt have a steady schedule and is super unstable. I had some shifts last fall, but since December there was no work. I managed to get on unemployment benefits, but because of that, and my depression, I ended up being stuck at home pretty much all January and February. Didnt feel the need to go out anywhere. My sleeping schedule became super irregular, sometimes sleeping all day, sometimes not being able to sleep for days. 

My gym was the only thing keeping me sane, but of course I fucked up as well... I was bulking heavy since October, but making zero strength gains, so I decided to order steroids, and I just got a letter from the police saying that they got my package. They will tell me what my punishment is in 2 weeks, and I am so scared that I will end up in jail, since I heard that Denmark is super strict about steroid use. 

As for my summer job, its really, really bad as well... I work at the outside street food market (if you are Danish, you probably know the place), and this Friday we are having our first pre-opening meeting. I hate that place because of the double standards (they dont really care if you are good at your job, only if you are good at sucking up to the managers and if you befriend the managers you can get away with everything, last year there was a guy literally giving me death threats and he wasnt even fired, just asked to apologize to me) and the fake positivity (you have to smile and be happy all the time, i was threatned to be fired just for mentioning my depression). I was hoping to get promoted to a shift leader, so I could finally earn some respect, since I worked there for years, but I got ignored. 

I felt like music can be an escape for me, I am really into goth and industrial music, I am trying to attend to concerts if I can, and I was trying to make music like that myself. But ever since I moved here, I have absolutely zero motivation. I got couple synths and bass guitar all connected and ready to be played, but I just... never feel like actually working on it. Which in turn makes me feel even worse, even more depressed, even more likely to work on it, and so on. I have couple friends who are working on all kinds of music, and sometimes I just feel like I should just give away all my instruments to them since I will never use them. 

Finding mental health professionals is impossible here. I tried twice. I had to go through my GP, and the first time I spoke to her, she completely ignored me, with stuff like ""my teenage daughter is going through the same"" , ""just go and workout"", and so on. When she finally did let me see a psychiatrist, she didnt take me seriously either. I was waiting 4 months to see her, and I vented to her about everything, only for her to tell me that ""there is nothing wrong with me"". I tried again the year after, same story. 5 months waiting time, he says I am fine. And because of my student debt, and soon the inevitable steroid fine, I am way too broke to afford a therapist. 

TLDR: I know I am not fine. And I feel like I am out of options. Having no plans for the future, stuck between summer job where that fake positivity just makes me angry and depresssed, and winter with barely any work, stuck at home with instruments I am too depressed to use, and now possibly going to jail or being stuck with a massive fine. My only moments of... happiness? being goth shows, which end up fueling my depression and self-hatred, since I know I will never be able to make music myself. 

&#x200B;

If you took your time to read it all, thank You. And if there is anyone living in Copenhagen, who wants to hang out, you can contact me. I am up for anything, going for a walk, listening to music, watching some movies, anything to break to cycle of home-gym-shitty work.

825,The nostalgia makes me super depressed,"I often think about my earlier years as a kid, and I miss it so bad. Back then I used to have many friends, I knew everyone and they knew me. I left during middle school, which I regret, due to all the friends I left behind. I still have some of they’re numbers, so we talk from time to time, but haven’t seen each other in years, I’m worried my friends no longer care about me, I’ve known them since kindergarten, plus since I haven’t seen them in years, I don’t know how to stay in contact.

I feel terrible, I lack friends these days, and it hurts badly. I miss my childhood, which I will never get back, I’m worried I’ll lose contact of my old friends forever and I’ll be forgotten.

828,I feel like I'm just waiting to die,"I feel no joy in doing anything. I may have these random spurts of wanting to do something but when I get to doing it I quickly lose interest and stop. Like video games or reading or working out. I just don't feel like I have the motivation to keep going, and I gave up looking for reasons why.

I feel hopeless at times despite my best efforts to be optimistic. It sometimes feels disingenuous to say that I have depression. Life has not been very fair to me for the past couple of years. While I'm grateful for what I do have, I'm left feeling wanting. I want to love someone, I want to experience freedom when travelling, I want to be able to do things most people my age are doing. But circumstances prevent it so.

I feel like I live every day trying to find a way to pass the time, waiting to inevitably die. I wish I could ""seize the day"" but I often feel that there's no point. The things I look forward to, do not excite me anymore and it makes me sad. I feel numb at times.

Instead of being happy that I found a way into the course he just yelled at me for what I should have done in the past to get in, Things I can’t change.

832,Winter time has me feeling worse than ever ;-;,"I (17F) have been clinically diagnosed with depression last year after deciding to get therapy but have been depressed for the past 4 years. Usually around winter time, I get even worse and lay in bed all day. This is a major problem and is seriously starting to impact my life. I used to be really active in school by playing sports and attending multiple clubs. I had dreams, goals, and ambition. But now I don't want to do anything at all. 

My daily schedule involves me waking up feeling miserable, getting dressed (only if I want to go to school), going to school, and coming back home only to lay in my bed and rot for the rest of the day. Most of the time the only reason that I actually decide to get up is because my family is pushing me. But I'm afraid that I will completely give up on myself if someone else doesn't force me. Honestly, I have no idea how to change this habit since I have been doing this for YEARS. And before anyone tells me to ""just get up and do something"" I have been trying to do that but I always just revert back to my old toxic habits. 

I have spoken to my therapist about this before and she told me to find something that makes me happy and excited and try to occupy myself with that. But the problem is, the only thing that I really enjoy now is being on my phone and things that I used to enjoy like walking, running, drawing, etc. quickly become boring for me and I just fall right back into the cycle. 

I don't know what I need to do but I know I have to change. I cannot keep feeling absolutely miserable every single day. Has anyone overcome feeling this way and does anyone have any tips?",1b1v3ht,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b1v3ht/winter_time_has_me_feeling_worse_than_ever/

My attention span is nonexistent.

834,How to survive in an emotionally abusive household when you can't leave?,"I (22f) was diagnosed with C-PTSD after initially being misdiagnosed with BPD 8 months ago. I've been going to therapy regularly, but it's hard living with people who don't understand what you're going through. 

I break down crying often due to college stress ( I'm a med student in my final yr) and family issues (alcoholic dad with lots of debts). My introverted nature and lack of energy makes it hard to maintain friendships. Even crying seems impossible without being labelled ""crazy"" by my mom. 

I can't move out because I don't have any means of supporting myself and moving out is not an option in Indian household. I've been contemplating restarting antidepressants but a close relative advises against them. 

I'm stuck at home for another 1-2 years and I don't know how I can stay sane.

835,Today was it,"I’m going crazy. I’ve been going down little by little over these last years. Trying to make deals with god as if it would help me with a cop out. Sometimes I feel it’s going to work out and before it even seems like it will, 10000 other problems come and split open in front of me.  
I’ve been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for the better part of 15 years. I haven’t had a peaceful night of sleep since I was 13 years old. All I’ve ever wanted was someone to love me (genuinely not necessarily a romantic connection. any connection). For someone to understand me. For me to go to sleep peacefully and wake up peacefully. With this fantasy, I tricked myself into moving forward even when I didn’t want to all my life.  
But today, Today is the day I feel I lost it. My will. My hope. The one strand of hope that helped me push and push and push through what I thought were the darkest days of my life. The lying voice that told me that my horrible time was behind me. It failed to tell me the truth that, with every time I find the light in the darkness, it’s extinguished a little from inside me. I don’t know if I even remember all of those times. I just remember I’ve completely repressed the hell out of it. I used to lie to myself and say that even though I don’t remember the details, I remember what I felt. That’s not true. Had I remembered, I would have the courage to persevere further. I would have known that I am capable of handling this. Of any shit that comes my way. But let alone the slightest iota of self confidence, I am nose deep in self-loathing.  
I hate myself. I truly wholeheartedly hate myself. This is the most sincere feeling I’ve ever felt. I can confirm this because in 27 years of my life, I’ve barely felt anything other than guilt and shame that I was told I should feel.  
I don’t have the courage to die. But I feel like I’ve lost my will to live. I’m not sure what to do next.  
Please don’t leave comments that are positive that say “I’m here for you” “try to hang out with friends” “change your environment” as reading them now may only enrage me further. severe depression isn’t something that you can do all of the above with.

852,Sharing my opinion and 'problems',"(Spoiler alert: long boring story)

To start off, I am not really posting this for advice (always welcome of course) but I am curious to see if anyone can relate and I mostly just want to get this off my chest. Since I am not comfortable talking about this with my parents, and I dont want to be labeled by a doctor, knowing everyone will find out. So I chose internet strangers to talk share/talk with about my problems as a way of relief.

I am a 20 yr old male who has been feeling down for quite some time by now. And to cut to the chase, it has mostly to do with my physical appearance. Ever Since I was a little kid I have been aware of how I look (not great xD) and trying to hide it by being funny and 'confident' when I am really not. I have been coping for a long ass time, and for the past 3/4 years my feelings have been caching up. Untill this point where I am sharing my feelings, which I find to be very uncomfortable. 

I have friends who would tell me stuff like: ""its ok... idc about how you look"", or "" I could go outside and pick 20 guys uglier than you in a second"". I know they mean well, but I am not a fool xD, i know what this means. Combine that with the fact that I have never even hugged a girl, the fact I dont have a single female friend and that they have never taken an interest in me tells you and me enough... I am also not a creepy dude or anything, I have a lot of friends and I get along with almost everyone, but I am merely the funny guy.

When I think about the future, I dont nessecerely (not english srry) want to be rich, have kids, or a wife, I think I just want to be happy. My personal hygiëne is ass, cause i only brush my teeth and shower when I have to go somewehere. I either eat a shit ton of junk, or I only eat once a day. I dont get anything done and my room has 3 garbage bags that have been staring at me for over half a year. These 'symptons' have led me to believe I may have been feeling a little depressed. 

Also my whole life my parents and teacher assumed that I may have autism and ADHD or ADD or whatever, but getting a label like that will only make things worse for me I feel like. 

Is anyone else here fairly ugly? So yes, is it still bothering you? I am kind of at the edge of seeking medical help, but if I can cope a little longer... I dont have to go xD.

854,going too far ,"i’m not sure if this is even depression anymore, or something else, but i have dealt with depression since i was young, i had my first suicidal thought at 9 years old. before i even knew what that meant. my whole life ive spent feeling consistently sad, all of the time, nothing else. i’m 20 now, and the past couple months have gotten worse. i don’t feel anything anymore. i don’t feel happiness, excitement, sadness, guilt, pleasure, empathy. i don’t love or even like anyone. all i feel is contempt and annoyance. i dread seeing my “friends”, i dread talking to people, even hobbies i once found pleasure in have become more of an annoyance.

i don’t care about anyone or anything they might go through or say, my entire time spent awake is pretending to care what people say and carefully choosing my responses. i keep people around me as they will be useful in my future, but i would much prefer to spend my life completely alone. 

i have found myself thinking bad thoughts about people, strangers and loved ones, which i never would have thought of months ago. intrusive thoughts, that i just can’t seem to shake. i find myself wanting to hurt my “friends” and family, emotionally, and i do not know why. 

i feel like a shell of a person, just someone who other people can project onto and create a version of me they would prefer, and i cater to it. because i am not a person, so i change who i am around different people. i be who they want me to be and it serves me. 

i’ve lost dozens of friends in my life, i grow close to them and cut them off suddenly with no warning. i do this everytime. in the past month ive cut off one of my closest friends and i do not feel anything. they are quite upset and ruined by this but i just do not care.

I'm socially inept and as I've gotten older I don't even care about my lack of a social circle. All I do is wake up, sit down at my desk to work and then feel trapped by an invisible cage. My days exist to work and then wait till my family goes to sleep so I can stay up late to be alone. Each night I put off going to bed because I don't want tomorrow to come and end up having to repeat in my head you don't have to wake up to drift out to sleep.

I can't kill myself because it wouldn't be fair to my family. I always hope my body gives out in my sleep and that's the end. I know I'm depressed but there always feels like there's just something fundamentally wrong with me. I feel like I'm going to explode, not in anger, but like there's a pressure in my head and the rest of my body.

878,I hate my life,"I hate my life and I don't have any hope. I am only 20 and I have so much to live for but I don't want to. I have nothing to look forward to. I had a relationship which made worth living for a bit until she practically discarded me. It has tarnished my self esteem and I have hit rock bottom. I almost failed my semester exam because of the whole breakup, my parents are also giving up on me and I am just pretending to be okay so that they don't make me feel worse. I go to therapy but it hasn't made anything better yet. I gave my all to this relationship and made it my only purpose of living. My friends don't even check up on me given they have witnessed my terrible condition. I feel like a burden because all I do is sulk around and none of my friends really want to hangout with me or talk to me. I feel the worst because I have always been there for my friends when they were struggling but they don't seem to reciprocate it a bit. Nobody really checks up on me. My parents are homophobic and have literally asked me to stop being depressed over the breakup because they don't want others to assume my sexuality. I have a friend who checks up on me daily but I feel guilty as all I do is sulk around and doesn't have any fruitful conversation. I still don't know how can people just forget my existence when I have been nothing but good to them. I still can't fathom the treatment I got at the end of the relationship, the awful things they have said after being there for them when they were at their weakest. I just wear myself thin for every person and every bond in my life and in return I barely get any of it. I have always been depressed and that relationship kinda made me feel alive for a bit, but now I am just lonely, friends and my parents don't really care about me anymore. And all I do is try to reason everything out but at times it's just too much to even rationalise things. I don't really see a point in living and I know I am just too coward of a person to kill myself. So I don't know what to do, I really wish every night that I don't wake up the next day. I am barely surviving and slowly withering away. I don't feel good enough to even exist tbh, I know I am so young and have so much to look forward to, but I don't want to continue living like this, I can barely trust anybody anymore, I just want to isolate myself in a room and wither away.

882,Healing from depression: Is it normal to want to leave the friends you made while you were depressed?,"So I’ve definitely been pretty down the past few years and have completely lost myself. I would say I learned a lot during that time period but would definitely call it a period of depression: no joy, numbness, sleeping in, loss of enjoyment in passions, loss of creativity, tons of self doubt that I buried in false personas… you get it. 

But I’ve noticed that I’ve made some of my “closest” friends during this period, friends that I would turn to and would be there for me no matter what and it felt like we could talk about “anything.” Even if those “anythings” were just spirals of negativity and fear and me being inauthentic. It felt like those friends were comforting, and all that I had. I rarely felt enjoyment being with them, in fact, I mostly felt misery, so I’m very torn with what to do as I’m learning to be myself and enjoy life again. It feels like those friends don’t even know me, and they just keep me stuck in the person I was when I was deep in the shit. 

So I guess my question is: can anyone else relate? Is it normal to lose the friends you made during depression as you heal back to your healthy self? Or is it better to try to take them with you since they were there for you through such a dark time? ✌🏼",1b1r12n,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b1r12n/healing_from_depression_is_it_normal_to_want_to/

884,How can I cure my boredom/depression," I'm an average guy in my twenties, struggling to find motivation in life. I'm stuck in a monotonous routine of work, anime, gaming, and mindless scrolling on social media. I have a weak body, short attention span, and often feel depressed. Nightmares haunt me, and I sometimes have unsettling thoughts. I feel emotionally numb and disconnected. 

Deep down, I know I still have some kindness and self-awareness left, but everything seems to be falling apart. I'm becoming cold-hearted and empty inside, oblivious to the world around me. 

Given my unhealthy lifestyle and unstable mindset, I wonder if there's anything positive I can do to improve my situation. There are a few things I've thought about, but I keep procrastinating or avoiding them, thinking they require too much effort. I have a strange interest in stutter/flash videos with Stutter Techno songs in the background, like a high-minded experience.

I've poured out my thoughts and experiences here, and I might come back to this post later. I don't have high hopes of finding someone similar and learning how they overcame their challenges, but I'll see.

886,I finally made it out of the hell hole.,"There are various reasons for people to go into depression. I too had many. As insignificant as it may seem, people pleasing was one of them. Please do give a read.

We live in a society where things must go as predicted. This is the reason we all try to do our best to keep things in order and hoping for them to go our way.I too, was trying my best to keep things in order and ensure they function smoothly. In that process I relied on external validations (Smile,head nod,compliments etc) to feel more useful to the society. But then things went down to an extent where I gave up on everything. Looking back, few people did tell me to learn to say no, and I didn’t think much of it. For me saying ‘no’ to others equated to being selfish. And after deep introspection I realised that every time I said ‘yes’ reluctantly even when I knew it wasn’t a big deal, I was putting others before me.

To my subconscious mind:

>It meant I valued others feelings more than mine.

>It meant I valued others time more than mine.

>It meant I valued others happiness more than mine.



Your subconscious mind takes everything in. And when you're depressed, it only pushes the negative thoughts to your consciousness and these thoughts disort the perceived reality. Be careful about what you put into your subconscious mind. It takes everything inside.



For me saying 'yes' reluctantly, was like putting on a ‘YES MAN’ mask. And when I moved to a new place,I consciously and subconsciously,started feeling inferior to others.Anxiety started kicking in, my life started falling apart. In fact,I would never negate others opinion just to fit in and to not come across as rude. I started treating others more nicely than I would treat myself.I kept everyone on a pedestal.It’s a rule of nature that if you are ALWAYS selfless, you’ll perish.



I did have lot of friends. Like they say, a friend of all is a friend of none. It didn't feel like they were legit ones. I didn’t feel like being my  true self around them because I wasn't completely comfortable/myself around them. This obviously led me to having people who didn't match my vibe. But still, I used to hang out with them for drinking, road trips and clubbing. But everytime I needed an emotional support, I couldn't get any from the ones I thought would be helpful. Also my girlfriend at that time would always get things her way.I don’t blame her,It was her circumstances that made her that way.We are all products of our traumas and how we manage them.





It shouldn’t be surprising that I  spiralled down into severe depression because of self loathing and no emotional support.I popped almost every class of anti-depressants there were over a span of 8months.After Meds, CBT and lots of reading,I came across being ‘Selflessly selfish’. It means you should not think about being good to someone nor being evil to someone ,just don’t think about them at all.Obviously ,do make some  exceptions for family and close friends but, even then you should be the first priority. As clichéd as it sounds before the flight takes off ‘ when the cabin pressure drops, you should put on your oxygen mask before you help others.’ It applies to every aspect of our lives. Only when you are safe, you can help others be safe.



During my depressive phase, all I had were negative thoughts. I even attempted to end it. I’m glad the rope broke. Since then I have lost the fear of death, after all I attempted to bring it on me.



 ALWAYS remember two things:

>It’s not the thoughts that are problematic, it‘s the amount of importance we give to them.

>Thoughts are not reality.

Once I realised the problem, I was able to peel that filter which only let negative thoughts into my minds eye.



Since then, I have thrown that mask  away.I have been myself truly. I started expressing my thoughts which also meant I started negating others whenever it felt appropriate. I started saying ‘no’ to people whenever I felt I should be prioritising myself. I saw a few changes:



I felt more confident.

My friend circle started changing, I started attracting people of my vibe.

Energy parasites detached.

I started loving my life rather than just trying to survive it.

My current girlfriend makes me feel at home.



It’s surprising that seemingly small things can you can control impact you to an extent where you lose your grip on life.

Presently, I’m working as a doctor.

You know, being a doctor is cool and all, but my proudest moment wasn't actually getting through Medschool. It was overcoming depression. That was the real fight.

And always remember:

887,Inner demons,"**NOTE: Grammatical errors and SUICIDE. This is just my inner thoughts at the moment where I was really down. I need outside perspective on what's really going on. It's okay if you guys are completely brutal and honest with me.**

.............

Well the conclusion is I am an absolute TRASHHH nothing I ever do is rights apparently I just copy pasted everything... Maybe they're right... but it was supposed to defined each qualities but my mistake was that I didn't put an in text citation. I paraphrase each line though... Fckk it just accept it there's nothing to lose anymore. I've got nothing. I am nothing just a good for nothing. All I do is bring people down. Swallowing another shame huhh honestly at this point I've grown numb to my faults after all I've become nothing but mistakes, flaws and everything miserable. Just absolute TRASHHH PLS DEEI PLSS JUSTTT STOP ALREADYYY

They say that the better thing to do is just accept and learn from it. I want to honestly but... what else am I fighting for my pride?? Wat pride? Ego? Probably? I guess I just wanted to feel like maybe Ii aint like a trash after all... but time and time I was proven wrong. That I could do something right. I want to take a break just be alone somewhere far away pls just take me away. So shameful. Everyday feels like I'm being corrupted slowly not by my surroundings but by myself. I'm feeding myself poison each day and I'm slowly dying. Probably because I am addicted to it.

But another side of me just says to accept it there's nothing I could do about it nah. Be the bigger person and overcome it. And it's what I trying to do. Honestly at this point it seems like I am so detached from myself that even if you completely publicly humiliate me it wouldn't matter to me anymore. Throw me to trash I just wouldn't care. What I would do would just analysed each situation like some mathematical problem to be solved. Without feeling anything I guess that's my biggest problem. A problem to be solved and something to get dopamine from. Just like a math quiz on paper, something I just fo to do but at least quite fun. It feels like just a machine walking not me not my whole being just a character to this world.

893,"I dont know what to do, I dont know how im supposed to feel","I've delt with depression twice before in my life, once as a teenager when I was getting bullied by my friend group and again when I ended my relationship with my mom. And now I seem to find myself reliving my depressive symptoms with no explanation that I can think of. 

I dont want to live anymore, I feel alone, I feel isolated and I feel like nobody truely cares about me. The only urges I feel is to live the rest of my natural life in suspended animation, not alive but not dead. 

For the past three years I have been living with my girlfriend and her family after my mom kicked me out of her house. They have accepted me into their home and have told me that I am their family and have taken very good care of me these past couple years. After I got kicked out of my moms house all I had was the clothes on my back and $50 to my name, I now own my first ever car, put myself through college and landed a pretty good job. Even tho I am in a much better place and ""a different person"" from who I was three years ago, I dont feel happy, I dont feel proud.

Even though I am in a much better place I don't feel like I have any sort of value. There's nothing keeping me tethered to this earth, there are no pets that depend on me for food, there are no humans who will be impacted by my death in any way shape or form. If I where to die this second, the memory of who I was will only be a passing thought to those who surround me. Maybe I am selfish for wanting to be mourned or for having something depend so heavily on me, but I don't think its wrong to want to be wanted. My partners family say that loves me, her sisters call me brother and her parents buy things with me in mind (like picking up a pack of pogo's because they know I like them). Despite all this I do not feel like they truly do love me. I never get a ""how was your day?"" ""how are you doing?"". Feeling like a ghost in the house, eating food and taking up space. Nobody seems to want my company or simply interact with me. And despite me being in a happy relationship with my partner, a part of me always reminds me that if I where to die that she would move on and replace my position in her life. I know its selfish I know its sounds fucked , but I am just so sick and tired of feeling replaceable, I want to feel permanent I just want to feel fucking loved. I dont know what if wrong with me, why despite being told that I am loved I dont feel it. I feel like I have my neck in the hangmans noose just waiting for the floor to drop from under me to put me out of my misery. 

So many times, so many countless times have I wanted to seriously injure myself just to be able to see how those around me will react. Who would visit me in the hospital? Who would stay by my side as I fight for my life? Who would cry if they heard that I was in a accident? who would be relieved to hear that I still draw breath? Like I drive my car and just imagine myself getting smoked my a semi, blood dripping from my head, consciousness starting to slip slowly by steadily away,I die without knowing it I would die without warning. And when I think those thoughts I feel good, relieved. Sometimes when I'm alone I put a knife to my neck and cry, I cry because I cant muster up the courage to do it. I fear death but I yearn it. My hobbies and sex dont give me any joy like they used to and noting but pain feels natural. I burn the tips of my fingers to constantly feel that pain, so that it lingers for days, so I can constantly feel those feelings of relief. 

Im fucked, and like the title says I dont know what to do. I havent told anyone about this because I dont want to be seen as fragile or as someone you gotta keep your eye on. I just want to be treated normally and these feelings to go away. I really just looking for answers or some advice.

The “You” means nothing to existence. We are just a lumpy pile of matter that learned to rearrange other matters for their own benefit.
Your friends, family, they too are nothing. Just necessary bonds to your host for survival. There is nothing to the world. Everything, emotions, marvel, beauty, happiness, love, shock and pain, all came from “You”. From “your” perspective, the little chemicals in your brain dictates all that you feel and comprehend, as it was apparent through discoveries in the biology field. You must realize, there is absolutely nothing greater out there. No point to live, that is unless if you are religious and believe in an afterlife, which I meant absolutely no offence if this did. Life itself is a mishap. There is no point to its existence. Just convenient matter that happened to be able to stay together.
This is reality, where all “your” actions literally mean nothing at all. All “your” achievements, all that “you” love and “own”, is nothing. Existence doesn’t care. Existence is itself. Existence continue on without your opinion.
Its funny how people chases the small things in “life”. The price for a meal, the joy of watching make-believe movies, reading make-believe stories. Love. Fun. “You” are not getting anything out of that. Its all just “you”. “We” communicate to “ourselves”, saying how a tiny part of existence changed to “their” liking or mourn.
Yet, even knowing this, its impossible to escape this reality. It exists, and so did “you”. Its everything. “I” still feel sadness. “I” still feel excitement typing these words. “I” am a “useless” man. “I” know that. “Usefulness” all depends on the thoughts of “your” “matter”, at which I still am not.
“I” can see poets writing about love, singers on stages live for their crowds, “me” thinking about how to type in here. Why would we do that, when everything else is nothing?
After all, all that “we” can think about is “us” and even more of “us”, “our” offsprings will will probably continue on thinking the same thing, until the day that we all die and be forgotten. Until that day, we are still stuck in our small community on Earth, arguing about the latest stock changes and the price of oil.
Its harsh. I know that, I felt that. That is why I chose to ignore it. I chose to ignore my very own philosophical opinion.
Since there is nothing to nothing, which is meaningless, I might as well make myself think that there is something to exist for. The matter in me, when together they can feel joy, a concept that is enjoyable to me. I can feel the joy of others, and in turn I too feel joy. When I succeed in my tasks others and I set myself, I feel triumphant, even though it is ridiculously pointless to existence.When I post this somewhere on the internet, I will feel anticipation, hope.
I will let myself enjoy the “ignorance”, for now. My biological will to survive wants me to continue on to survive despite know the idiocy of life, and maybe to read other’s opinion on this. We are just so “We”, self-centered. Its impossible to feel anything other than what we perceive as “living”. Sometimes, maybe ignorance is happiness. Ignorance is bliss, and so I heard and confirmed.
My question is, after/even knowing that there is ultimately no point in existing since we will never achieve anything except for ourselves or accept the fact that we are too small to comprehend how self-centered we are, why do we still go back to our normal, everyday lives, or simply stop bothering about our own existence?

897,Problem with relationship ,I am depressed and my boyfriend had some issues last year but this year he tries to be good and does activities and stuff that I don’t have the courage to do. And I know it’s bad but I feel jealous and bad about myself and I get triggered all the time because he is feeling better and I don’t. I don’t know what to do ,1b1p5y7,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b1p5y7/problem_with_relationship/
898,My dad told me I'm a coward and deranged for being depressed and suicidal,"I'm 23 years old and jobless, just got out of a three year relationship and I am at the lowest point of my life. I'm too much of a coward to actually kill myself, but my will to live is just slowly fading away.

My parents have been somewhat supportive. My mom has always been there emotionally for me, but even her snaps out in desperation for seeing me suffer and not being able to do anything to help me. 

My dad is another story, he has always looked out for me financially and I know that he loves me, but he just has the emotional maturity of a baby. He has never looked out for me emotionally and always runs from any emotionally difficult situation, and I honestly resent him for that.

He said that suicide is for cowards that don't want to face life and that's when I told him about my suicidal ideation when I was 17, he didn't take me seriously and said I was just being dramatic.

Today he got pissed off because he sees no progress of me ""getting better"". I told him that I'm severely depressed, that I want to die but that I'm trying to get better one step at a time. I tried to leave the room but he stopped me, grabbed me and got physical with me; I thought he was going to hit me just like he did to my mom multiple times in the past. I pushed him away and yelled to him to never touch me again.

I went to my room and he confronted me, told me that suicidal people are cowards again and that's when I finally snapped: I told him he was a fucking idiot and a coward for running away from problems. I told him ""Then I should kill myself so that you can go around and say that your son died because he was a fucking coward""  He said to me that I was fucking crazy and deranged and I got ready to beat his ass and that's when my mom showed up to stand between us and de escalate the situation.

He ran away and according to my mom, he's been crying all day from what I said to him. I have never yelled at my dad or got physical with him, I love him, but I just can't when he calls me names at the lowest point of my life. I want him to be there for me, but he thinks that money will solve everything and has never bothered to be an emotionally present father.

I hate that I yelled to him like that, but I don't know if I can ever forgive him for what he said to me when my life is quite literally in danger.",1b13ey9,24,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b13ey9/my_dad_told_me_im_a_coward_and_deranged_for_being/
899,My boyfriend is manically depressed and I can't help,"This is my first post about something like this, so sorry if this isn't the right place to ask for help.

For some context, myself (30F) and my partner (29M) are in a long distance relationship, but that has nothing to do with his depression. But this might be useful information to know when it comes to offering me advice. 

My partner has been in a manic depressive spiral for the past 2 weeks and I feel utterly powerless to help him. I have asked him what I can do to help, but he says I there's nothing I can do. I've told him I'm there if he needs to vent, or just distract him without fear of judgement or me abandoning him. He appreciates it, but i still have this awful feeling like I might say something to trigger him and subsequently upset him further. I also wish I could be there physically, but even then he says there's no guarantee that he'd be any less depressed.

I guess I just need advise on how to approach this and reassurrence that I'm saying the right sort of things. I don't want to keep asking him ""how are you feeling?"" Because I already know the answer. And he already knows I care about him. Immensely. 

I'm a very empathetic person so hearing how depressed he is upsets me greatly and today I had a full on hyperventilation attack from sobbing about it. But of course, I can't tell him that. I don't need to add to his plate of worry. I just want to be a pillar for him and for him to not worry about coming to me with his problems.

900,the urge to completely and utterly ruin my life.,"im writing this in a rage and as some sort of outlet i guess. maybe i can get insight but the thought of someone else reading my experiences makes me feel more validated for some reason.

recently, ive been filled with so much grief and pain and anger for the world that i have the urge to just lash out and ruin everything. i want to ruin my health and my relationships and drop out of school and break things and just destruct everything in every single way. i want to break everything until i am left by myself and i want to be so self-destructive that im not even worth anything anymore. nothing feels real, i feel so apathetic to everything.

all my life ive been a mega people-pleaser, to an insane degree where i cant even enjoy myself around my own house for fear of siblings/parents being slightly inconvenienced. i know where this stems from (a long childhood of being the youngest child and constantly being told i was annoying/an inconvenience) but i dont wanna get into that. since birth ive been a punching bag for everyone else and nothing i ever say or do is taken into consideration. the world has always punched at me and i just want to punch back for once in my life. i want to do the impossible and just lash out and ruin everything. nothing is worth anything anymore. my whole life ive been so logical and calm and level-headed and peaceful but for once in my life, after just 17 short years ive had enough. i cant be the worlds punching bag anymore.

i dont know what i hope to achieve with this reddit post but i think putting it out there might help or something, i dont even know. im just so so so filled with feeling right now and i didnt know where to go.",1b1c08c,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b1c08c/the_urge_to_completely_and_utterly_ruin_my_life/

What are some good alternative's to therapy. Therapy ain't really gonna help me get enough money to pay bills and I don't think it would solve the bigger issues in life.

Can't really get any aid either since I'm a dependent technically and my parents are upper middle but they only tell me to fuck off.

904,Afraid of this feeling.,"I was with this women for a year and we had moved in together, me, her, and her friend.
At the beginning I knew it might’ve gone sideways if I messed it up, we went a long while being together and enjoying the days we’ve had, she made me so happy. Then it slowly starts to go downwards once jealousy and clinginess got into play. It seemed as if I became too connected to this women. I started spending money i don’t have on her just to please her. I always wanted to spend time with her. I was always putting her before me. We had gotten into an argument, it was silly and dumb, but she had broken up with me because of it. I owned up to every mistake I’ve made and would hope she had the patience to let me learn. We are both young, i’m 20 and she’s 21. Obviously because we live together and her friend was there, she started talking to her friend, telling her everything I’ve done wrong, and now they both don’t like me. They talk about kicking me out and constantly ignore me. I pay 700 a month to live in this apartment and it kills me seeing her everyday and having her ignore me. She drinks heavily and is a very angry drunk… she’ll try to break me down completely. Insulting and threatening me. Saying she’s gonna fuck other dudes and if I’d “want that”. Being an overall emotional person, I’ve been put into the worst depression. It killed me thinking about how I’ve forgiven her for everything but she’s so quick to leave. I know I’m now an adult, but I can’t help but to cry, it makes me look weak but I just can’t help it. I’m stuck in a position where I don’t know how to let go, and I try so hard to rekindle things. It sets me back in life and I’m finding it so hard to do anything. It’s a terrible feeling, for a person to leave you because you didn’t suit her needs. Because you weren’t good enough. I know I shouldn’t come to Reddit with this, but I just never thought therapy was worth it. Talking to a person that doesn’t understand my feeling. I have goals and aspirations, but it’s so difficult and unmotivating with this feeling. How do I let go? How do I mask this feeling?

I only wish that I had one thing of my desire going in my life, but I got ugly face, ugly body, a gender that I don't feel good about and fucking no talent or communication skills, or even fashion sense, I just see others and feel disgusted by myself, I feel sub par and like an alien, I have felt inferior for around 7-9 years now, and this feelings has gotten worse and worse, none of my efforts pay.
It actually gets worse, I started balding at 21, and now I wear hoodie and hat to hide my bsdk shaven head, it gives me dysmporhia and dysphoria, haven't taken a picture in 9 years, haven't ever had a real friend, always shallow interactions and idk how to be normal like others, how come I can never be good enough, idk everyone says good stuff and it gets better when I talk to people online, but I can never fucking her anywhere irl.
I just wanna die, run away or become a NEET and stay shut in forever, I don't have any place in real world, I am not normal like others and I just wanna die, nowadays I am thinking about jumping on the metro track or jumping from college building. 
Real shit is the feeling it's always the same, no matter what I do, I have lose hope about stuff, have been trying to change myself for quite a while now, you can say 5 years minimum, but shit only got worse. Now I am In a sport where I just wanna fucking become invisible or better yet stop existing, can never feel good enough to be with people, and none really wants to be with me anyways, so alone and worthless, I feel like a burden when someone is paired with me, like a dead weight...

ive been depressed for a while now so that's nothing new but today after school i just immiendetly broke down crying. thats not that unusual for me either but today it was diffrent. the feeling ive felt today actually reminded me of the grief the day i found out my grandma died. ive had this feeling of unwashable hoplessness since i first broke down today. i had a panic attack like this once but it lasted less than an hour, but ive been feeling like this for the past 7 hours and I'm scared this feeling won't go away and ill stay in this horrible mode of grief and hopelessness forever. 

after today i strangely wanted to go back to school, which is weird cause i do not enjoy school these days. I don't have any friend's at my new school and the amount of missed schoolwork is making me stressed out. but suddenly the thought of being at school felt comforting.

an important thing i should tell you is that last week one of my teachers asked me after class what was going on since i had so many absences. i ended up telling him i had depression. he was really nice about it and i felt good after that interaction. but after that for the next couple of days until i had a class with him i felt so anxious like nauseating type of anxiety to go back because i guess the thought of someone knowing about my problems made me really anxious for some reason. and don't get me wrong!! this teacher is nothing but the best. being back in class today wasn't bad at all, since the teacher is really nice.

&#x200B;

Dear all,  
I'm writing because I'm in a really tough spot right now. I've been feeling like I'm battling with myself for a long time. I've tried to be kinder to myself, but it's like there are different parts of me that don't get along, and I can't figure out which side to support. I want to start by saying that I want myself to be better, I really do. Writing here is also helping me in a way. I hope you can follow along because this is quite unstructured, and I am writing in the order things are appearing in my head.   
When I was 15, my parents went through a really bad divorce. It was filled with violence, both physical and verbal, and a lot of mental abuse that lasted for years. Luckily, I've always had good friends and people I could count on.  
As time went on and I stopped talking to one of my parents because they left me and never talked to me again. I started binge drinking for months on end when I was really young and never got the confidence or self-esteem that my friends did. Even though I'm good-looking, tall, and smart, I feel small on the inside, like a tiny version of the outside me. I often have to act like I'm okay and confident, like what people expect from someone like me, but it's hard.  


I hate the fact the parent who abandoned me is doing so well in life and I can't start building myself. I hate that in essence, they won. They broke me and I never recovered. My other siblings are no better either and as the eldest I feel like I failed to help them because I couldn't help myself. One of them almost killed themselves due to an eating disorder while the other one is growing up with their first memories being of my parents fighting.

  
My other parent gave me a lot of chances in life, but I always end up feeling sorry for myself and really hating who I am because I don't do as well as I think I should with these chances, which makes me feel guilty. I've been through heartbreak and never got over it. I've felt everything from not caring to being sad, hopeless, and desperate, and my ability to get things done has changed a lot. I even hate the way I cope with negative emotions. I wish I could suffer ""differently"".  
The emotions I deal with are too much for me sometimes, and I've thought about suicide more than once because of it. I never went through with it, although I was very close, because of the guilt I'd feel towards others who love me and how it would affect them. If my non-existence had no effect on them at all I would have probably done it by now. 

I've been to therapy and I am still going, but it only makes me feel okay for a few weeks or months before I fall back down again. I feel happy for a while at times and even motivated. I get a lot done when that happens. The problem is that I can't stop wanting to punish myself and not let myself get better or grow. Therapy is good, but it can't seem to ""fix me"" despite my best efforts.  
I feel jealous, guilty, and overwhelmed.  
The idea of not trying makes me feel guilty towards the people who have always been there for me and given me everything. But trying is always so hard and painful. I'm fighting against myself in an uphill battle.  
I want to help myself, and I have before. I exercise regularly, study, and am in a relationship now. But I can't keep my emotions steady, and the smallest things throw me off.  
I stopped drinking a few months ago, and it helped at first, but now I feel just like I did when I was drinking.  
I also smoked weed for about 6-7 months straight because I couldn't sleep and needed something to distract me. I quit that 6 months ago as well.   
I don't know where to start. My life is exactly how I want it to be right now, with all the perfect chances to get better, but I can't stop trying to hurt myself through failure, giving up on myself, and thinking negatively. I wish I could be more free, less socially anxious and just generally more willing to stand back up when life (naturally) pushes me down. 

I have a lovely intimate relationship, great friendships that have endured since childhood, a loving parent and many loving family members. I have nice siblings and I had so many opportunities I am grateful for in life. The fact I feel this way is due to some dark unexplainable force inside me that fuels self hatred, even though I can perceive how lucky I am and how much good is in me and in my life in general. 

I hope one day I can start facing life fully and not with half of me always working against me. That will be the greatest day of my life. I can feel like I can achieve so much if only I felt a bit more consistent emotionally.

I miss being a child, I was truly happy then. It makes me sad thinking how weak I became and who I generally became. Younger me would be embarassed.

I'm a single mom, disabled by multiple chronic illnesses that keep me from being able to work at all so I live in extreme poverty. I have no support system and barely any friends.

921,Am I the real problem?,"Idk how to start this...
But I'm struggling with a lot...
I have health conditions and symptoms that got worse with my unmedicated mental health for several reasons and not excuses.
Today I made Mom left our home because I'm just a bad person that do not care about my own life or others.. and I'm supposed to be their right arm but I failed to make these work EVERY SINGLE DAY.. because if ONE DAY I couldn't even wake up at a certain time, HELL is waiting for me. The fact that I'm 24F and living in Asia, so the concept of a strict family with (hidden NPDs) is still existing. 

But maybe I'm just a coward... my parents are old (and Dad is the one has NPD but he is a different story that I recently managed to ignore him for the sake of my overall health).. but mom, she started unconsciously to be an emotional abuser like my father.... she never done bad things to me (only physically but emotionally... she is really good at making everything on her side) but to be honest she is kind when she is in a good mood.. but I'm NEVER meeting her standards and expectations EVERYDAY, because if I miss only one day, the only simple thing I can say that I am NOTHING to her, literally.. 

she is workaholic, perfectionist, believer, had a successful career, but she also had me, she don't want me to work because I have to take care of her... she succeeded, I gave up on looking for jobs because of this..I'm also the one acting like her Narcissistic Husband, the one who don't give a **** about her or anything else but his life and needs + I am the reason of her cries everytime I don't meet her standards and expectations. 
-----------------

My problem is that I learned not to express my feelings because I don't have the right since my brother's life worse than mine (he is disabled).
I once remember telling how I struggle, I wanted them to see that I struggle too.
I broke the wooden table once with my bare hands when they were not present because I was angry.. but once she knows that I did that she cried telling me ""don't act like your dad and your brother, they are enough for me.""

-----------------

I'm always the walking problem-solver for them.. I am that energy that suck up all their anger.. always listening and make things go easier.. I never get MAD my entire life. but please tell me and slap me in my face by the harsh trurth that I AM THE REAL PROBLEM.. so I expect my place in hell and prepare for it.

------‐----------

I realized I was doing everything right for their only sake and not mine... I studied hard just to make them proud.
And please don't lecture me how toxic this mindset because it is literally written in my core and it's hard to not think otherwise because I'm strongly emotionally attached to them.

I'm literally questioning my own existence from the age of 5.

Lol idk why did I even wrote this.. cuz who gives a f? I'm not seeking anyone's attention and I know this is a universal experience and no one will ever care and I only have myself in this process.. you know what? Fuck you, fuck me, fuck this society.

927,I feel like I can’t sit down and relax,"23F, just graduated college in May of 2023, and live in an apartment with my partner. Currently holding a part-time job (10-3 for about 14.50/hr, so not terrible) and been recently trying to lose weight while also trying to do more art throughout the day.

Right out of college, and a little after I got my job, I started getting depressed. Felt like nothing was going nowhere, I wasted my degree and can’t do anything with it, and I was unsure if I was where I was supposed to be in that moment (ROCD is a bitch, as well as imposter syndrome). I started gaining weight, letting the apartment go to shit, did nothing all day when I’m home, and cried a lot.

Right after New Years, I had a few weeks of being ill and bedridden while my BF worked a lot of hours. On my only day alone, I was able to get up and do some chores and noticed how crappy of a state my apartment was in. So, that kicked into gear keeping up with chores and doing a massive overhaul on cleaning.

From there, I went to weight loss. I started with just dieting, but then it developed to now trying to get 30min + walk in and some light exercises when I get home. I’ve also been trying to learn how to cook. On top of this, I picked up learning to paint, while also planning to learn embroidery or Blender.

The thing is, now I feel like I can’t sit down. I feel… better? But the moment I sit on the couch and start to scroll on my phone, I feel like I’m going to cry and that I’m all alone and trapped in adulthood responsibilities. I feel like my life is so… BORING! I want to be doing more things in my life, or at least get a different job, but I have been struggling majorly to find something. But the second I get up and start moving around again, I am zoned-in and can do a lot.

This only seems to be the case when I’m home alone. I’m somehow fine if my partner is also home? Unless I’m by myself, which can start a depression spike.

Anyone else go through this? I feel like I can’t relax and it’s driving me nuts",1b1man8,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b1man8/i_feel_like_i_cant_sit_down_and_relax/

932,I wish my mom died. ,"I love her as much as I possibly could, but this isn't about her. She used to be the only person in the world who gave me hope that I could find what I'm looking for. She is the only one that keeps me going. But today she is no longer a enough of a reason to belive, to have hope. Still, she is a barrier for me, that tells me to keep living, because I know if I died, she would die right after me. But I no longer have hope, I only have a barrier. 

I wish she wouldn't love me so deeply, I wish I knew she would continue. But I'm lying to myself. And I selfishly wish she was dead so I could turn all of this off, without all of that guilt. 

She is the only one I can truly count on to care about me. No one else does, and I fucking wish they did. I wish they cared that I loved them. They don't. 

And I can't talk with anyone because I'm full of shame. If I told my friends what my love does, they would pity me. If I told my love what my friends do, he would pity me. Both would think I have no self respet, both would judge me for staying, for begging them to love me, to respect me. 

All I ever dreamed of was a house in the countryside. A partner who would crawld with me in it at night. And a room for guests such as family and friends to come and visit. That was all, but I can't have it. 

Nothing is ever mine. My job can be taken away, my house can be taken away, my friends come and go and my love is always leaving me. 

I don't want to be happy anymore. I want nothing. I just wanted to be loved. I wanted to share. I wanted someone that cared the way I feel I do. I can't find it. Maybe I don't deserve it, maybe it doesn't exist. Either way, I don't want to be here. ",1b11ssw,23,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b11ssw/i_wish_my_mom_died/

941,Turning 20 soon and I feel like I'm not living,"Hello,
So I'm a first year student at college in engineering and I've become lethargic and chronically bored. I'm turning 20 in less than a month and I've realised how I've fucked up everything already. I failed to live. Most people around me enjoy life, they hang out with friends, they have fun, or at least they're holding it together. People at my age have already had relationships, already lived their own adventures, and I feel like I've missed the boat. I do not know how to make friends anymore and have no experience whatsoever with relationships. 
For context, I lived with my parents, and was pretty introverted, during high school, mostly never hang out with anyone outside of class, I then did a 2 year pre-university program, with mostly the same attitude. Throughout high-school, I was enjoying my time, but wasn't really going out of my confort zone. Then at approximately my second year of the pre-university program, I started to actually want to socialise, meet people, and be less introverted. I couldn't, and didnt put really much effort into it. Then college came and move out to another city, didnt go into residence for financial reasons, and rented a studio alone. Problem is that the university life is inexistent. As a result, I have been extremely lonely for the first and second semester, tried socialising with people in class but most of them shut me down. I ended up finding 2-3 people who are friends, but we don't really hang out much, they're mostly too busy, even gets me thinking of whether we're even friends. I also tried myself at searching for a gf, although I'm aware that finding a gf will not wipe away my depression, at least it may help part of the process? Maybe? Anyway, I've only been to one date with this girl we talk a lot but I am considerably more attached to her than she likely is to me, and I am way too attached to someone that doesn't really care about me. She probably doesn't like me and I wouldn't even know if she's playing with me, but I'll keep pushing and see what happens. Also, I have to admit that I have started this process because I found uni life too dull and wanted some action. I am aware that this is a pretty unhealthy way of doing things, but now it's too late.
I also stopped enjoying things I used to enjoy, like gaming with friends, or reading. When I do that, I do it obsessively for 9h and don't even enjoy it. I am sorry for the poor structuring of my thoughts but the end result of all that, inability to find friends, no experience in relationships, no hobbies to enjoy, no university life, I feel bored, all the time. I have a lot of free time and I do not know what to do with it. I only enjoy time that I spend with other people, I am unable to enjoy time alone anymore. Its like I was switched from an introvert to an extrovert overnight but wasn't given the necessary social skills. I usually end up wasting my time on YouTube or other useless apps, feel much worse afterwards. So I do not know what to do, but I am not living, barely just surviving to time. I've considered suicide couple of times but never actually planned anything as it would hardly solve my problem, barely annihilate the fact that I'm not living. I would be interested in any tips or ideas or anything to get out of this situation.",1b1ktzl,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b1ktzl/turning_20_soon_and_i_feel_like_im_not_living/

He was everything to me and I miss him every single day he made my days so much more fun and eventful and he just broke up with me so suddenly, He supposedly relapsed on heroin but in reality he just found another girl and it was the girl I was worried about. I just hate how bored I am and how alone I feel, I tried to do substances to cope like benadryl, weed, opiates, and shrooms but honestly it’s just making me feel less and less real. I honestly just feel like I died when he left me and I know it’s pathetic but he was all I had i’m basically a loser at school and don’t have many friends and everyone thinks i’m weird, which i’m not I usually just keep to myself and don’t talk much but people still talk bad about me.

946,Partner in Therapy - Advice ,"My partner of 10y has suffered from depression for a long time. I have had issues with depression in the past, and have bad days, but it is mainly under control through lifestyle changes and medication. My partner however, is still going through it. And has been on and off for the last 10+yrs. They are currently taking medication and going to therapy and I have seen them really make an effort in the past 2yrs. I am so happy that therapy is working for them and that they have an outside source to confide in. The issue is I feel that my partner doesn’t share their feelings with me anymore. We are either having a wonderful day together or they completely shut down. When I’ve asked them about it, they said it’s not my job to make them happy and that they will discuss with their therapist. We’ve also recently had some tragic events happen, so I don’t want to push. I honestly understand where they’re coming from and I want to respect their boundaries, and I never pry as to what was said in a session, but I feel left-out. I even feel jealous of the therapist sometimes, which I know is not healthy. Has anyone experienced this? I want to connect on a deeper level but I also want to allow them mental space.

947,venting and confused,"!  
I think I may have depression. I'm from a lower-class household in Morocco, so mental health was not always a priority; we were just too poor, and we still are. Recently, my mother was diagnosed with it and was medicated. It was a tough few months, but she has mostly ""gotten over it."" When she was seeing doctors and taking medicine, I felt jealous because for the longest time, I have been through countless episodes of extreme highs and lows, but they never knew or just shrugged it off, saying, ""You're still young, what do you know?"" or ""You don't have time for this, go do stuff with your life."" You know how we are; we can't add this crap on us, kind of thing. But I don't know if I'm thinking like this because that is exactly what happened, or if it's all in my mind. I used to know when I'm in an up or down position, but now I don't know. Recently, I haven't been doing anything; I can't get myself motivated enough to do anything. I don't really want to talk, but I feel lonely af. I feel sudden bursts of ups, but they don't last, then I just go back to binging YouTube. I would watch anything; I can't sleep unless I put a silly video on so my brain would shut up. I have never reached out or felt the need for someone else to know what I'm feeling, so I never shared with anyone, but I know that I have been lower than this. I used to want to end myself; that feeling is not here anymore. For now, I'm so confused; I don't know what is happening to me.",1b1js1w,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b1js1w/venting_and_confused/

950,That period where a girl and you don’t act friendly?,"As a young adult, i felt like i hit this brick wall with an aspect of socialization that i was true afraid to understand or confront, and thus overcome.

When you’re good friends with a girl, and you might like her and you might not, and she might like you and she might not, what do you do when things get sour?

If I as a guy don’t reciprocate some “feeling” she has for me, is it normal for her to act cold and mean? At some point, it even feels like she makes me feel bad on purpose. Or am I just missing the attention she gave me? What’s the proper way of handling this? And I feel like girls do this all of the time to the extent they can be purposefully harsh or hurtful towards me. Does being friendly with girls always entail getting romantic with them?

951,Taking my medication every other day instead of everyday,"What could be the worst consequence of taking Loxx 60mg every other day instead of taking it every day? Honestly, I'm just continuing to take it to avoid withdrawal symptoms. My last checkup was last September. It was my fault for not scheduling follow-up checkups. Sometimes, I try to stop taking Loxx for 2-3 days but withdrawal symptoms start to kick in so bad that I always decide to continue. Due to financial constraints, I can only afford to take it every other day.

I've already scheduled a follow-up checkup, although there's no specific date yet. I'm just preparing myself because I might be reprimanded severely for the way I've been taking the medication.",1b1jg3e,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b1jg3e/taking_my_medication_every_other_day_instead_of/
952,I ruined my life  ,"Hi, I didn't know where to go, and I needed somewhere to vent this is a trow a way account I don't know if that the right way to write it, this isn't my first lenguaje anyway I just turned 24, and my life after highschool is a completly mess and a lie, before university I got a lot of diplomas and was in a constant state of learning and training with new stuff, I had good grades and they even give me a scholarship for keeping the good work but after that part of my life ended I just went downhill and I just don't feel I can't get up, I started an engineer but deam they really kick you hard when your math and physics skills aren't up to date I really tried studying and preparing my self but after countless failed attemps to approve subjects, I just give up ñ, I keep pretending I was trying or lying to myself that I will do best next time but next time never came, and before I knew it I developed some kind of phobia to studying or even trying to go and present an exam, and now I'm stuck in a constant lie to all my circle, all are having high expectations on me because all of the previous achievements in my past but I'm nowhere near that I just can't lie anymore I cry myself till I'm exhausted so I can sleep, I'm a fraud, friends and family ask me how I'm doing with things and I just lie to them that everything is going great but that's not the reallity it's just me pretending so people don't look down on me.... I got used to lie to them but now I have a partner and she is wonderful but she already has a degree and is currently working and seeing I can't be with the same time as her in her life is really hurting me, even more lying to her that I'm doing good with my grades... I'm thinking of ending the relationship Even if it is the best thing that happened to me, but I won't be dragging her in to my bad decision's I do hope she can found someone who can go at the same time as her and makes her happy, sorry if it was too long but if you read all this rant, you have my thanks and I really hope you are doing well even if it sounds ironic I do hope you can use my favorite phrase ""De nada sirve llorar por leche ya derramada"" (It's no use crying over spilled milk)  and keep moving on",1b1avpl,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b1avpl/i_ruined_my_life/

958,I’m losing hope,"Hello, hope you’re doing better than I am. Kinda as the title says but I’ll explain a little. I’m currently in college (English so like high school for Americans, I think? You can go in and study at what ever age in our colleges), studying accountancy, however despite it being my first year, I know I’m not going anywhere with it, the course itself is fine it’s just that I know I won’t go anywhere in life with my “skills”. I’m a terrible person, I ruin everything around me, I have no skills, nothing good that I bring to the table and I’m a complete and utter failure. No one should like me honestly, I don’t get why people want to be friends with me. I’ve told them I’m a terrible and worthless person but they ignore the warning. I know im also going to die alone, im not attractive to either gender (I’m bisexual) and I don’t blame anyone for not wanting to be my partner. I blame myself for everything I’ve done wrong, no one else is to blame it’s just me, I’ve ruined my life and I don’t deserve anyone who is in my life. Everyone I know is far far too good for someone like me.
