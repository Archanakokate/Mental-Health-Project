We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at \/r\/depression\/wiki\/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the \/r\/depression and \/r\/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt\/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","Score":2364,"Total_comments":177}

Well, with your permission:\n\nI've suffered depression\/been depressed since I was around 10 yo until this year's  February (2019).\n(Major depressive disorder, severe depression, you name it. The first  condition it's only a raw translation from my native language to English, although it may be different as the actual English name, sorry if I've made a mistake)\n\nI don't  want to offend anyone here or make this condition appear to be worse than it really is, but for me, it was Hell. Perhaps I'm  lacking the proper words to describe it but for me it feels\/felt like that.\nAround the same age ( I've  started  my toxic relationship with depression) I've  developed anxiety disorder, I'm  still struggling\/fighting against that B****.  A nasty combo.\n\nFor some reason unknown, even for myself, in some moment in that time I've started to think about both conditions as females, ladies, nothing against them obviously, they are more beautiful than men,  proved they are more intelligent than men and without the ladies we are just savages, love them all. Xp \n\nNow, as an adult (25 years old, male) I've took a phrase for myself, it says, more or less:\n\n\"Depression is nothing more than a sad lady knocking at our door in a rainy night. Let her in and listen carefully what she has to say, but do not let her stay. Once the rain has stopped, say goodbye to her.\nOtherwise, she *Will* get into every corner of your house( Inner me, mind, etc), and kicking her out it's hard, painful and takes lots of time, wasting life. You don't  have to be rude, though, learn how to treat her, listening her words and advising her are the best way to help her and yourself. Letting her stay and being rude will start  a war between both of you, a nasty one, and in the beginning, she is always stronger than us. \nTakes years to overpower her and acquire control.\n Listen the echoes inside of you, the voice around you and read the words dedicated to you. It may be someone nice trying to be nice with themselves or he\/she could be someone struggling too, trying to make you know that there's others with their own wars, some of em had lost some battles, others had won, but all of em are fighting back, see them and learn from them. A few others have lost the will to fight and this lady took their heart, alongside their last breath. I never forget them, it could have been me.\nThere's stairs to heaven, highways to hell and the unlimited potential we all have to evolve, let me tell you my secret ;) :you seek outside the reasons, help, strength or anything you think you need to not give up. You NEED to go and look inside, think about  it. We are amazed by the wonders in the space, maybe because we already forget the beauty of the jewels in the deeps of the planet. That's the hint. \nI'm fool and forget to mention another possibility: if the written words were made for your eyes, the voices for your eyes, or the cheers for your heart, it could be a type of people I admire, respect and decided to become one of them in the future: The friends beyond all the fight. Because you'll find a friend in almost every one of them. And they will be one (or both) of two things: and adviser\/helper, like masters, to share with you where they did stumble in their path and suggest useful things.\nOr your friends, doing the same as the first, and even more, much more.\nThey've learned to appreciate anything that shines in the darkness after living there for so long that they don't  want anybody to feel the same, and if you let me include myself with them, we will do such things because we like it, and we mean it. \nI am or I am not. Always. I'm always Too much of anything or absolutely nothing,  There's no mid points to me, I pour my soul in every thing I've decide to do, always help to anyone I can, serve the others and do good recklessly. That's one thing or two I believe in.\nSo, c'mon Bro, grab this hand I didn't had and take the strength I've lacked. Anytime you want, mate. That's why I'm here for.\"\n                                                                                                         The mind of Sun\n\nThat's a little thingy I wrote not so long ago, I've felt it would be nice posting it here,  it's  not the complete thing, it has some holes intentionally, but it's the first 80% of my own writings I've post ever. Hope it doesn't offend anyone, if it do not help you by any means, hopefully don't  hurt anyone either. I like to write, you know, my poison  of choice are poetry and philosophy  (damned poetry \ud83d\ude02),\nAnd if you catch even the tiniest bit of the deep meaning it also have, you already figured it wasn't a cute this half of my life. Lived in the bottom for years, pretended to be fine bc like we all do, I didn't want to worry not even one of my love ones, I was unable to have a treatment with a psychologist or psychoanalyst, and my whole list of sins didn't help much either.\nI've even tried to \"end\" myself  (sorry for this) four times.\nObviously, fortunately, unsuccessfully. \nAfter I've surpassed, the very first day after, for the first time in years, I've  woke up, happy. I don't  remembered the last time it happened. A couple of weeks after I've decided to believe in the things I've mentioned in my poor writing above, among others. And even more in those in the last two lines.\nI didn't had anybody to help me. Support me, freaking avoid I've tried those 4 things.\nI'm not fully recovered, I believe  this lady never really leave, it's always lurking but nice you won her, it's  more hard for her to regain full control. I've decided to always go beyond if I find myself a limit for anything, return anything good people do or give to me 10x  times better, if it was something bad, I'd return them something 100x better, don't  be cruel, don't lose yourself, do not treat people as bad as they are, treat them as good as you are.\n\nMany people here would probably know what cost me to learn these things too. \nThat's why I wanna help and give my full disposition when I've reply something similar.\nRegardless I do like to know all kinds people.\nAlthough I don't think of myself like a hero or anything.\nI'm trying to save pain to people that haven't reach that point, help the ones there, and for all the people struggling I'm  saying: I'm here for you, if you want. Just say the word.\nI don't start a chat, perhaps because I would be acting for my own selfishness at first glance.\nIt's  the way I respect people's desires. \nAlthough, I know how hard it is. \n\n\nTHAT'S IT, I'VE EXTENDED MYSELF QUITE MUCH.\nMY APOLOGIES HOMIES.\nI ASK YOU ALL TO FORGIVE MY GRAMMAR, I'M NOT A NATIVE ENG SPEAKER, LEARNED IT BY MYSELF, STILL POLISHING IT, I'M DOING MY BEST. \nTHE WRITING IT'S OBVIOUSLY PHRASES I'VE READ AND LIKED, MIXED WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS.\nI USE THESE QUOTE TO SYNTHESIZE MY OWN THOUGHTS\/WRITINGS.\nI'm still a bit embarrassed for it.\nLet me quote a hero:\n\"Whenever you suffer pain, keep in mind that it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of and that it can\u2019t degrade your guiding intelligence, nor keep it from acting rationally and for the common good\"\n\n\"My relationship to them. That we came into the world for the sake of one another.\"\n      MARCUS AURELIUS \n\nYou are more than you think, stronger than you feel, loved than you believe and unique than you perceive.\nSeek something you like or care about, make it a hobby. And do it relentlessly. \n\nThings like mindfulness, stoicism, a essay\/book of a subject you like, even slightly interested in, are helpful too.  Learn more things, do more things.\nOnce you realize what's stopping you, bringing you down, you'll gain power over it and it will get weaker and weaker. \nYou are far more than you think.\nI believe that, soon you'll  do it too.\n\nRegardless the feedback you guys give me, I'm  here.  Keep that in mind.\nWhy not? ;)\n\nGood vibes homies \u270c\u270c\u270c\ud83d\ude0e\nI send you all a Bro hug. \nYou can.\n\nEdit: I gave some format to this text, I'm on a mobile right now, you know Reddit don't care about formatting and stuff.\n2. I'm respecting the rule of no offering pm or smh, this was a last time. It could be helpful too, hard to measure and globalize something too random as the human being.

Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.\n\nThe crux of the issue I found is, you don\u2019t know who you are helping. You don\u2019t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.\nAs well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don\u2019t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don\u2019t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.\nAs was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.\n\nMy own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.\n\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!\n\nBut as I said, you don\u2019t know who you are helping and they don\u2019t know you.\nAnd if you aren\u2019t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.\nAccusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.\n\nTo all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\n\n- Role modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\n\n- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\n\n- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.

I hate the life that I've crafted for myself. I'm almost out of my twenties with nothing to show for it. No friends, no memorable experiences, no long term happy relationship, no career to speak of it. I've hardly done anything with my 20's. I can't believe it. I hate the phrase \"you're so young, you still have time\". Yeah, I used to think that, and now I'm still in the same position as when all those people used to say that to me. Now I'm not so young anymore. Thinking that I was 'still young' was a mistake. It just causes you to slack and not try as hard to change circumstances because \"well, i have time, i'll do it tomorrow, next week, next month\". No, you don't have time. Time is the most expensive thing and you never get it back. All the experiences I dreamed of having when I was younger, that I was gonna become a beacon of my community and change lives... lol even just simple things like wanting to walk around the mall with a friend or watch a movie with someone, all my dreams are dead and buried. High school me would've been so disappointed. I would've killed myself back then if I knew I'd be where I am now.\n\nAnyway, trying to get into a new jobfield. I'm upset and annoyed that I've been waiting since August to work with this company, but I still have 2 interviews to do and then 3 weeks of training, only if I pass the interviews (and now I have to spend money on interview clothes). I won't be able to start working until December, maybe January. I just thought the process would be quicker but now it's gonna take so long. I need money now. This whole process is slowing me down and I'm extremely antsy, haven't been employed since July 2022 I'm so bored just being in the house all day, nothing excites me and I can't afford to do anything. It is so stressful being a human. I wish I didn't have to do any of this stuff. I don't even know what I'm doing it for either. I'd be getting a job just to help me continue to survive... but I don't like living. I don't want to make money to keep living longer. I guess the solution would be to starve...

Receiving a frantic phone call from a loved one and talking them down from the proverbial ledge when I'm already stressed out is not my idea of a fun afternoon.  Oh also when someone is depending on me to move an x,xxx lb machine and cinch it down for a four hour road trip without it falling and crashing and killing people.\n\nThis is why I have no dreams or aspirations.

Thought I could make a comeback from a one month hiatus. During that month I felt absolutely awful - I barely could get out of bed, I was drinking every other day, I abused my medication etc. I felt absolutely lonely, and lost. When you're 25, and have the desire to drop out of a higher education institute for the third time... It just makes you feel lost and pointless. I couldn't get to see my doctor, and I had the desire just to end up in a mental hospital\n\nI actually felt decent at the start of December. Now, Christmas went by, and I feel like absolute trash. I was at my relatives house with my family the other day, and I didn't feel like I was there. It all just went by. I had a complete outer body experience. It felt like a dream. I guess that happens to you when you drink for like 4 days in a row.\n\nI didn't take my meds for a while because it completely destroys your libido. It just feels like I occasionally need to experience self-pleasure because it takes you out of the constant negative existence. That's why I've been abusing alcohol, food, and drugs occasionally.\n\nI just feel absolutely lonely - I haven't talked to my best friend for many days, I don't have any meaningful social interactions in my day-to-day life. Communication becomes a task when you have a few people wishing you a merry Christmas, like 4 people sending you meaningless memes, and some people I don't have the mental... push, I guess, to answer. Lately, most people get no answer from me. I obviously feel lonely because those aren't meaningful interactions.\n\nI also feel envious at my best friend who has been in a relationship for some years, yet I've gone on 33 dates which has yielded nothing meaningful. You sit on tinder or bumble for years but nothing comes of it. I obviously don't believe that finding someone will automatically make you happy, but I feel as if some people get scolded for wanting to find someone when that's a perfectly rational desire.\n\nI took three days worth of pills as of writing this, and I hope I don't have a good day tomorrow because at this point feeling terrible feels most natural to me.","Score":3,"Total_comments":0}

I'm awful with this stuff, and also got severe memory loss, so not sure if I missed anything since last time though there's not really room for error. \n\nWell, if you got three failed attempts you're locked out so I'm not trying my luck right now. I'm in such a bad mental state I couldn't make a phone call to unlock it again either, especially not on a weekend. Parents are coming home next days so I'm gonna ask them if I missed anything.

I'm a home health aide and I got a client, a woman who lived with her son, near my house that I could walk to. I thought it was so convenient. Unfortunately today, my second day working there, when I started cleaning the kitchen I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye and I hear a weird sound. The living room is right next to the kitchen and there is only one bedroom where the mom sleeps, the living room appears to be the son's room. So I turn around from the kitchen and I see the son laid back on the couch, pants off, stroking his genitals while looking at me. I was like wtf and just turned away and kept doing my work. I wasn't really sure how else to react. I only looked briefly and was telling myself maybe I imagined it. I didn't look directly at him or make eye contact but I know he saw me turn my head and look for a split second. I just continued my job as normal and told myself this would be my last day working here. Crazy thing too is he didn't do this just once. The first time was when I was sweeping the kitchen. After he was \"done\" I guess, he pulled up his pants and went to the bathroom then came back to the living room. I went to get a mop and bucket to mop the kitchen floor and as I mopped he started touching himself again. I went to mop the bathroom and came back to wash the dishes in the kitchen, then he started again. Basically anytime I was in his field of view he started doing it. I would enter the room and his pants were up, then at some point they'd be down again. \n\nI know people are thinking why didn't I leave right away. Idk. I wasn't sure what to do, this was my first time witnessing such a thing, and on my job no less. I just wanted to do my work and get paid, I don't like confrontation, and I guess I'm not the type to freak out over such things. I was just thinking as long as he keeps his distance we won't have a problem. I finished my work the woman asked me to do but the problem was the apartment was very small, and after I was done with work I would've had to sit in the living room with the son, whereas before I was distracted\/focused on my work and wasn't very near him. There was pretty much nowhere to sit anywhere in the house, not even in the mom's room, except the couch the son was masturbating on, my only option would've been to stand around in the bathroom the whole time, away from the living room and kitchen where the son was.\n\n The mom seemed pretty nice and I'd been doing this work for her, so after I finished my duties, I went to her room to let her know that her son was being inappropriate and she looked concerned but also imo not too surprised, as though she knew her son has done such a thing before. She told me she was sorry about it and I left, called my company to tell them what happened and now I have to go fill out a report which I don't really want to do, just want to forget about it. But yeah, I've heard negative things about this job field before but this was the first uncomfortable\/disrespectful thing that has happened to me so far. Kinda upset because I liked being able to walk to work, but this dumbass pervert had to ruin it for me. Was too good to be true.","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

He's been really selfish lately since when I ask him to talk or drop me off somewhere or anything really small he's always making excuses for why he can't do it. He'll say he'd rather not, or he's not good at talking to people, or my room is too messy and so is his if I ask for someone to talk to. Barely see him despite living next door to him. I'm much older and watched over him when he was younger all the time, giving him his bottle, even occasionally helping change diapers.  \n\nRecently I asked if I could use his curry to make some curry (with vegetables I bought). He said no, since he'd have to buy more. I thought of this as a last straw. He's always critical of whatever I do. But fuck there's empty toilet rolls on the ground in the bathroom and have been for months even before I arrived. He's not some paragon of a person himself, can't even bring it outside the bathroom to the trash.  \n\nI said fine I won't use his curry but not to eat the food I buy. He eats pb and j or whatever desserts I buy. Then he tried to say that I can't use the family's white car, that our parents own, because he uses it for work. He's been really possessive about the white car, the only one he's willing to drive cuz he's a spoiled little shit, for years. Wants to take it if he moves out but I know he probably won't move out. My parents don't bother him nearly enough.  \n\nWhen we go dragon boating he says it's ok to drive there after we'd decided to go by public transit but only if I drive. He's always trying to get out of doing any work. He just doesn't want to drive or pay for parking. He tries to get me to fill up the gas tank even being so spiteful as to come back with a near empty tank since he accuses me of always using the car. The thing is, and I argue this, I mostly only use it for local trips 2 miles away, not hour long commutes to work.  \n\nBut whatever it's only $40 I go fill up the tank. He wants me to fill up the white car half the time. The car that was supposed to go to me. But he's the one who uses it like 70% of the miles, my mom using 20%, and me another like 10%. How is this fair?  \n\nHe says I can't eat anything he makes anymore. And then threatens me with an \"are you sure you want to go down this route?\" Honestly I'm not sure if this is even worth reconciling. He's my brother, we don't choose our brothers. And I don't even know how we turned out so different. Genes probably. I can never get away from him being my brother but I sure can limit how much I talk to him.  \n\nHe's 23. All these years of me giving him the good room, him giving me the shitty chair he broke, always leaving more desserts and junk food for him when we were younger because I know he liked them, taking him to the park, giving him only compliments and trying to help him, getting into games to try to play them with him, teaching him science, playing with him daily, letting him use my laptop from games when I got back from work during internships. Sharing it when we were younger and giving him more time. And now I find out he's just a prick who doesn't care about any of it.  \n\nWhat do I do? If it were a friend I'd just cut the toxicity out of my life. Perhaps I let him get away with too much. Perhaps my mom let him become transactional when he was younger and that somehow developed into his narcissistic personality.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

They make me feel even worse about it and the experiences I've lost out on due to depression and social anxiety.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I thought about it but a prostitute would not give me the intimacy I want.\n\nI am wondering if anyone feels depressed about lack of sex and intimacy as well?\n\n","Score":115,"Total_comments":83}

Withdrawing from social life and self isolating is convenient, I do that too, but apparently really not good for you if you're trying to crawl out of the depression hole again - but making the effort consistently to grow close intimate friendship and connection is really difficult while fighting depression. But it seems like your brain is screaming for you to try it. You can always rub one out yourself, but you can't hug yourself or feel heard by yourself.","Score":3,"Total_comments":0}

I'm overweight, I have a lazy eye, and I also have wavy\/frizzy hair. To top all of that off, I have pcos so I also have a ton of body hair, I'm balding, and I have a beard lmfao \n\nListen. You're probably not as ugly as you think you are. Depression, body dismorphia, and other mental things make us feel uglier than we are. \n\nEven if you are ugly, OWN IT. Tbf I'm thankful I was never as attractive as my other sisters. It made me who I am, and because I wasn't drop dead gorgeous , it really made me work on myself as a person. Yeah, I'm never going to be the one people look at first, or second, or third, or even fourth or fifth, but my personality makes up for that. (I hope.) \n\nI used to feel that way too. It was really hard watching all of my more attractive friends and sisters get liked by the people who I liked, and always getting treated better and getting more attention than me. Believe it or not, there is an upside to it. My sisters and my friends have all gotten used for their bodies and their looks by some really shitty people who didn't actually care about them. And that must have been really hard for them to go through. No one did that to my ugly fat ass though lmfao \n\nLooks are not everything. And in the grand scheme of things, looks fade. We all get older and less attractive, and even the most beautiful people can't  escape aging. What remains as we get older is who we are. \n\nI PROMISE there are people out there who will look past your looks and love you for YOU. And there are actually probably people who do find you attractive, you just don't notice them because you don't feel worthy of love. Being beautiful has absolutely nothing to do with being worthy of love and happiness. \n\nWork with what you have. There are ways to style frizzy and wavy hair. And make up does wonders. Also, finding a sense of personal style and dressing to suit your body type will absolutely help. Also, STOP COMPARING YOURSELF TO WHAT YOU SEE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. With all of the filters, plastic surgery and photo editing, most of what you're looking at isn't real. \n\nSo from one ugly sista to another, it's okay to be ugly. EMBRACE IT.

I make 2 grand a month if im lucky and that instantly goes into either groceries, my car, or other misc things. \n\nTo survive i have to starve myself and eat 1 meal a day. and I usually skip eating on weekends all together. I wake up wishing I didn't every morning. I was raised in a religious household so I'm terrified of suicide because I was taught that would be a sin and I would end up in Hell.

I started going to the gym a month ago, its actually surprisingly fun. The reason why I started working out? I wanna change my physique. How did I start? I asked one of my friends if she could show me what to do at the gym \/ how the machines work. She plays volleyball on a national level and has been going to the gym actively for 2 ish years, so she knows quite a bit about that shit. People really dont give a fuck about what youre doing at the gym, I only talked to one guy whom I didnt know just to ask him if he was using a machine I wanted to use. I've bought some pre work out and recovery powders, bought some pure creatine monohydrate yesterday. Bought gym shoes and gloves, too. I'd say that the gym shoes are the only thing you really need to get before you start going. I bought the gloves because I'm a guitarist\/pianist and dont wanna get too many calluses on my hands, haha. But yeah, I actually really enjoy going to the gym. I think thats the thing thats helped me become consistent. I wouldve most likely already stopped going if I didnt enjoy the act itself, because I have a pretty hard time building routines generally prolly cuz I've got ADHD.

It was very much to the point that a year ago, it didn't matter what I did. I felt like shit, had no motivation or energy, and hated the way I looked. After nearly a decade of telling myself I wanted to work out I finally did by walking around the block for 10 minutes then 15 minutes and got up to a hour in about a month. Of course I couldn't jog for the life of me due to still smoking but I finally worked up the courage to sign up for my local gym. It took me a week to finally go in cause I still had my doubts and still was anxious cause of how I looked and I knew I wouldn't be able to lift that much. My gym is a 24 hour gym and I went in at 2am and just went at it. 30 minute sessions turned into hour long sessions, hour long turned into 2 hour sessions I feel better I'm starting to look better, I have more motivation and it has helped with my depression to a point. I even quit smoking cold turkey and have been trying to do more cardio to improve my lungs. \n\nThe biggest thing I can tell you is you just have to pull the trigger get over the fear of going. If you can or time allows do research into 24 hour gyms like I did find the time where people aren't there and you will find out you'll go.

It's been several weeks and she's slowly increased how much she does, so now she's at 15 a day. I sat with this information for a couple weeks, telling myself to start doing this, but could never actually do it, until it was pointed out to me that I was just avoiding having to get back up from being on the ground. After having that pointed out to me I started doing 1 wall push-up and 1 squat every morning. I am currently at 10 wall push-ups, 3-4 squats, and have added some lunges and stretching.

If the weather is nice, going outside is the best because you get the sun and enjoyment of nature in addition to the exercise. If the weather sucks, make a good playlist or put on a show to watch while you\u2019re on a treadmill to make it more enjoyable.\n\nI\u2019d also recommend yoga classes for beginners because it\u2019s typically not too stressful on your body, it\u2019s a calming and accepting environment, and so so good for your mental health. \n\nWould also recommend getting a yoga mat for home.

I want to see what the future is like but I can\u2019t help to be disgusted with myself and everyone around me. There are still people out there that I appreciate and think are genuinely good people, but I just can\u2019t even remember what it feels like to enjoy talking with people or hanging out with people anymore. I feel so far from everything, and even when I cry it doesn\u2019t make me feel much anymore but it simply enhances my dread. I\u2019ve always felt like such a freak, and probably half of it is my fault but if I can\u2019t be myself why even be anyone at all? why even live if everything means little to nothing?

All of my friends have been getting summer jobs and I have been struggling to get one. I was really disappointed with my grades and then right after that I was getting rejected from everywhere I applied. Since the end of January I have been on a depressive spiral. I\u2019ve thought multiple times about how I want to unalive myself. I didn\u2019t make plans but the desire to be unalive is very much there. I think the grades and job stuff triggered a really bad bad time for me. I am barely surviving now. I struggle to do any schoolwork. I struggle to go to class. I struggle to not isolate myself from everyone around me. My friends know I was struggling with my mental health, but they don\u2019t know to the extent of how bad it has been. None of them have experienced depression so they wouldn\u2019t understand. I\u2019m also just tired of acting like I\u2019m okay in front of everyone because I am not.  I\u2019ve been considering take a leave of absence but it would make post grad employment even harder for me. I haven\u2019t had a single even semi good thing happen to me since last May. I\u2019ve been crying almost everyday, definitely at least once a week. I just upped my medication so hopefully that helps but I feel so so alone. The only person I have is my boyfriend. \n \nOne of my friends doesn\u2019t struggle with depression but was also struggling with me because of school stuff. Then everything started working out perfectly for her and her life is perfect right now. I\u2019m happy for her because she deserves it, but it\u2019s really difficult for me to be around someone who just has everything going perfect for them and is on top of the world when I am at the bottom. Im not jealous of the specific things she has but just about the happiness and the freedom. She said it feels like a weight has been lifted off her shoulders. The weight is still crushing me. No one relates to how I feel because no one around me is depressed or in as shitty of a situation as I am.\n\n I know these are all very much first world problems. I am objectively extremely privileged. I have a loving boyfriend and family. I\u2019m at an extremely good school right now. I feel like happiness has just been permanently sucked out of me this month because of how awful it has been. It\u2019s very difficult for me to recover from such awful times because I look back and feel very sad about the shit I put myself through. I constantly feel like I am not good enough. I feel like the fact that nothing truly good has happened to me since 2019 means the universe and the world is telling me how worthless I am. Not being able to get a single job when everyone else around me has everything working out for them makes me feel like no employers think I am good enough and noone wants me. I feel like the world is whispering in my ear, telling me that I am worthless and stupid and that I deserve to die. My depression makes me feel like I want to die to escape this pain and suffering but also that I deserve to die. It\u2019s extremely sad how mean I am to myself and other people would think I\u2019m crazy. I say I need to lose weight when other people still think I am skinny. I say that I am ugly or mid when I don\u2019t think I actually believe that, but I perceive the world to tell me I am. I say I am stupid when I graduated from one of the most selective and best universities in the world.

M and I have been best friends since high school. Weirdly enough we come from households where mental health is not taken seriously. I was always depressed growing up because of multiple reasons but the root of it was because I lived without my parents and with an aunt who could care less what I do. While I was in middle school I finally started living with my mom but it felt like we were always arguing and my dad wasn\u2019t in the future (we talk but we\u2019re not close). High school was a haven for me because I was a new student and know one new me so I was able to rebuild myself as not the quiet, depressed kid. I was lonely at first because I was the new student but everything turned out ok when M came to the school as a new student in December. We hit it off quickly and we depended on each other a lot regarding mental health (more so me then her) we made silly plans that we would live together when we graduated college and move away from home which at the time was the root of my depression. Now we are both juniors in college and we\u2019re both pursuing different things. Going away to college was the best thing I\u2019ve ever done for my mental health. I used my university\u2019s  mental health services and did therapy for a year. It didn\u2019t solve all my problems but I was okay and had methods to deal with my darker days. On the other hand M has had terrible time at her college. She always expressed how she felt alone. Recently she confessed to me that she wants to end herself. I immediately thought the worst and expressed my worries, her roommates have taken her car keys to prevent her from going out to buy materials to harm herself but they can\u2019t look after her forever. I tell her the things she could do to help her out of her situation but she didn\u2019t want to hear it. She doesn\u2019t wasn\u2019t to reach out to the suicide and crisis lifeline, she doesn\u2019t want to take the rest of the semester off to focus on her mental health, everything I\u2019ve done to help she denied or doesn\u2019t want to do. My last resort was to threaten that I\u2019d call her father so she could go eat,shower and do anything. I don\u2019t want her to get better through my threats and deep down she knows I\u2019d never really call her father (a man she hates but lives with). I don\u2019t know how to help her without compromising myself, the past few months I\u2019ve been working really hard on my mental health but hearing your best friend say she wants to die and doesn\u2019t care who she\u2019ll hurt in the process has really gotten to me. I\u2019m so mad at her for being so selfish but I\u2019m also scared that she\u2019ll do something and I wasn\u2019t there because I was selfish and was only thinking of myself. When she told me  that I started to cry but it\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t care how I\u2019m affected by her words. What do I do, how can I help someone who doesn\u2019t want the help I can offer?

One day I was sitting on my balcony around 11 AM and I was smoking my last cigarette and I was drinking my last beer that I had from the night before. I had a backpack packed up and I was taking myself into detox and, I hear from behind my blinds on the sliding glass door \u201cKevin could you step inside\u201c and of course I shit my pants because who\u2019s  in my apartment. Now right before that, I had thought I seen my mom walking through my parking lot which was weird. She shouldn\u2019t have been there and I yelled at the lady to see if it was her but she didn\u2019t respond. So I stand up and I go into my apartment real quick to see who\u2019s in there and it was two police officers to take me in to detox. And I told them I\u2019m not going If you\u2019re going to force me I\u2019m not going and they of course we\u2019re going to take me against my Will which they did, and when I got down there, I simply kept my composure and talked to each individual that looked like they were in charge, stating the fact that I\u2019m going to sue somebody because you\u2019re listening to the rants of a crazy woman. I am not suicidal and started listing all the medication\u2018s my mother is on and that she was crazy. I had called her the night before I guess, drunk and saying how I wanted to leave this world. So she was a concerned mother. But in the end it, she had a 30 day hold put on me by a judge. But I kept my cool, and I kept insisting that as soon as I get out of here, I am contacting my attorney. They got me in front of a psychiatrist in like a couple hours and he asked me a series of 100 questions that he was entering into the computer. He was shaking his head the whole time saying we can\u2019t hold you and they put me in a room and I just went to sleep and within a couple hours they were waking me up saying you can go now and released me. So of course, on my way out being very angry about this because I was doing it myself and they took me by force in handcuffs in front of my whole complex, so I was angry. And I called my sponsor who was involved in that as well and I told him I have five dollars to my name and i could use it to get  a ride home or I could buy a cheap six pack and I\u2019m gonna choose the cheap six pack and take a nice long walk. Enjoying my freedom. He was infuriated because of the trouble they went through to set that up. But in hindsight, I should\u2019ve stayed there and enjoyed that 30 days because they were taking care of my rent. They were gonna take care of my bills they were taking care of my job. They were in talks with my manager, which would loved me to have gotten sober. And my job would\u2019ve been held for me and my bills would\u2019ve been paid and taken care of until I got back. Now I\u2019m very careful what I say to anybody on the phone but I was drunk when I said that stuff to my mother. I don\u2019t drink anymore not to say I got sober then because I didn\u2019t, nothing like being resentful to keep someone drinking and I have plenty of that. That was back around 2012 I would say. My last drunk was in 2020","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

I don't enjoy the things I use to anymore or feel as passionate about them...video games are hard for me to keep up with as I end up just not finding them nearly as thrilling or engaging like I use to, I've lost a majority of my friends that I had for nearly 10+ or more years due to them seeming to just feel like I'm a lost cause who can't seem to move forwards or sometimes I was just told plainly \"You're just so miserable to be around anymore ever since you've gotten like this.\".  \n\n\nTruth is? I just desperately feel like at times I was born without a single purpose to even remotely say I have...I try to be close as I can to the parts of my family that aren't absolutely life sucking and try to genuinely offer me support, same goes for any friends who have stuck by me...but, I just feel absolutely purposeless...Being in the furry community use to be a major help to me sometimes as I met so many nice people with similar issues sometimes...but, honestly...I've just began to feel more and more detached from them. I always wanted to be an artist but have never been able to conjure up a single ounce of creativity or talent towards anything in all my life even with much trial and error.  \n\n\nSorry if I'm very poorly composed or if this post is scatterbrain and going everywhere...but I'm just...feeling absolutely hopeless lately and restless so I just had to write some of my feelings somewhere since I don't have that many people to vent to.","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

I just need a place to vent and see if  maybe I can get some help with working through my thoughts. So I\u2019m a 33M and the last two years have been a living nightmare for me and my mental wire is about ready to snap. So rewind back to 2020 where I met this girl she was 26 and I was 30. We hit it off quick and after 3mo we moved in together. The next two years were the best ever. Now we are in the beginning of 2022 and she ends up in the hospital with pancreatitis and was never the same after that. She was constantly going to the hospital for \u201cphantom pain\u201d. The doctors always said they couldn\u2019t find a thing wrong. I did everything I could for her during that last year. Took on financial responsibilities, took her to the hospital, cooked, cleaned, took care of our 3 dogs. She never wanted to anything because she always felt sick and started to grow distant. Well we\u2019re now in the beginning of 2023 and she moves 2hrs back home to get a job. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and I called it off. She blamed everything on me even though she just said everything I said she did was actually me. We tried staying friends. She wanted to get back together eventually but about a week later I find out she\u2019s sleeping with someone already. Well this is where I think she was cheating on me when she moved back home for \u201ca job\u201d. I paid off her car (I co-signed) which is 20k I\u2019ll never see again just so I could cut ties with her completely. We haven\u2019t talked since and I still miss her to this day. Well in July of 2023 a new girl (21f and I\u2019m now 33) starts working where I work and we hit off. She has a bf so we were friends. She wanted to hang out and drink. I said no because she had a bf and I was trying to be respectful. She kept begging and I caved. We hung out she got wasted and I put her in bed in my spare bedroom and went to bed in my bedroom. Well she says she wants to do it again so we do and mind you feelings are starting to develop. We drink get drunk and end up sleeping together. Me being the giant heart I am have now started to realize I\u2019ve fallen head over heels for this girl. We never hung out after that but continued to flirt and kiss for the next month. Then one day as I go to kiss her she turns away and it hurt so much. I prod and prod until she finally says she realizes she loves her bf and didn\u2019t like me as much as she thought she would. Ouch. I told her if she had any respect for him she\u2019d tell him she cheated on him but she said he will never find out. So now we\u2019re at the beginning of 2024 and I confront my best friend of 10 years about him being into guys. I knew he was but for 10 yrs he said he was straight. I called him out in front of our other friend and he finally admits he\u2019s bi and never was truthful with me because he thought I\u2019d judge him. He told everyone else the truth but me. So now I\u2019m starting to feel like a piece of shit. Like everything is my fault. Then I find out the supervisors at work don\u2019t want me to get out open supervisor position because they all think I am an asshole because I don\u2019t talk to anyone. Well it\u2019s a two way street. I talk to those who talk to me. Not to mention these same sups never work with me so they don\u2019t even know me. Now the I\u2019m a shitty person hole is getting deeper. I start thinking dark thoughts I\u2019ve never had before and I\u2019ve suffered with depression since high school. I\u2019m fighting myself to not become self destructive but I just want a way out that isn\u2019t caused by me. I know I\u2019ll get comments calling me a dumbass for falling for someone 12yrs younger than me. I know people will say maybe I really am an asshole. I\u2019m ready to accept all that. I just want to be happy again but I haven\u2019t been happy since 2020 and that was for two years. Before that I don\u2019t think I really remember a time I was truly happy. I\u2019ve tried moving on and meeting new women. Well I\u2019ve batted 0 for 3. Had 3 great conversations just to be ghosted and don\u2019t know why. ","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

But pessimistic thinking isn't realistic either, just because it's the opposite of positive thinking. \n\nOne simple thing you can do is take each of your negative thoughts and ask yourself 2 questions:\n1) is it 100% true, is it a fact?\n2) does it help to think that way?\nIf the answer is no, it's an overly pessimistic thought, one that is neither true nor helpful. \n\nExample: \nI will never contribute positively to anyone's life.\n1) 100% true\/fact? No, because you can't possibly know that that's what's gonna happen. Can't look into the future.\n2) does the thought help you? No, because it makes you feel bad.\n\nThen you can formulate more realistic thoughts and double check them with the same two questions.\n\nSo what would be more realistic?\nFor example, I don't know if I will ever contribute positively to anyone's life.\n1)True? Yep, you can't know what the future holds. \n2) Does it help? Well at least it leaves space for hope, so I'm gonna go ahead and say yes.\n\nIt's just a simple technique and of course doesn't replace therapy, nor is it medical advice or anything like that. \n\nAnyway, what is important now, in my opinion, is that you open up to someone. You did a great 1st step by opening up to people on reddit, maybe you have someone in your actual friend\/family circle you can approach.

Unfortunately this shit happens in this crazy world we live in. To get past this you probably shouldn't spend too much time alone. You need your friends and family for when these tragedies happen. You don't wanna be completely isolated that makes it too easy for the darkness to consume you. It's good that you have a cat but you still need social contact. You said you cut contact with your friends and family. I'm curious why? And don't be afraid to try therapy and medication. I struggle with depression and I see a therapist once a week. It's good to have someone to talk to about your problems and hardships you're facing. And in your situation you could really use a therapist especially if you're having suicidal thoughts. If you consider it you'll end up being so glad about it in the long run. And medication too. I take medication too. Obviously it's not a magic spell that heals me fully but it still helps me to get out of bed everyday and live my life without being too depressed. And if you're able to get out and do fun things that'll help take your mind off it. \nAgain I'm so sorry what happened to your boyfriend. These things are hard. But you gotta be able to pick yourself up and move on so you can get back on with your life.You're 25. You're still super young. You got your whole life ahead of you.\nJust don't forget to take action to help yourself so you can pick yourself back up and move on.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I want to know if anyone else can relate. The past couple months I've been really struggling with eating. I haven't properly filled my belly in like 3 months. I try, but I'm repulsed by food and it's reached a point where I've made myself sick because of it. I had to call off work and yesterday when I was back, I felt sick again and legit like regurgitated food back up immediately after trying to eat. I have always had issues with my appetite and physical hunger matching up. For some reason when I feel physically hungry, like my stomach growling or feeling empty, it makes me repulsed by food which obviously isn't ideal as that's when I need to eat. I also smoke weed as a bandaid solution but I know in the long run it's made everything a lot worse. Sometimes I'll have good runs where I can eat totally normally for a month but the cycle always repeats and each time, it lasts longer and gets more severe. \n\nI've had minor persistent headaches for weeks now, I feel feverish and generally just very unwell. I feel like my depression is causing me to slowly starve myself and the more I fall into it, the harder it is to get out of it. I'm going to try to start eating better this week but it's really tough, especially since my body has reached a breaking point. If anyone has any experience or advice for me, I'd appreciate it. I'm really trying and want to get better in general, I'm really sick of living this way and I think the first step is to take care of my body but that is a huge challenge. I'm so repulsed and uninterested in food right now and the thought of eating makes me panic. Any advice or tips would be really appreciated :) ","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I also heard a voice of my previous hamster Tea (who sadly died in a miserable manner because of a medical condition despite all we did to help her - vet visits and everything) saying to 30%  \"It's like this. They don't take care of their hamsters. This is why you are dying. Because they neglect you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo note that 30% has a mild skin fungal infection and we took him to the vet and have been giving him medicine daily. He is recovering very well and has not lost any fur for weeks. He has a giant cage with deep bedding and healthy food and by all guidelines he is very well-cared for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen in the dream I 'woke up' and had an argument with my partner because dream-partner kept trying to tell me that 30% was fine and I yelled at him to stop interrupting me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I woke up for real and my partner told me we didn't have an argument and I was so confused. And I was so convinced that 30% was actually dead and the current hamster was a replacement that my partner bought to trick me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd no matter how much I tried to rebel against the thought I just kept emotionally feeling \"this is not 30%\" when I saw my hamster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly after I watched 30% closely for over an hour and he demonstrated very 30%-like unique habits then I could convince myself logically that this hamster was 30%.

Tried to off myself many times since I was young -- cutting my wrists, attempting to do the carbon monoxide thing in the garage, overdosing on my meds, straddling my balcony to jump. Been to the hospital many times, and been in the psych ward. \n\nI stopped going to the hospital in 2019, because some nurse took it upon herself to get my driver's license revoked. I have a clean driving record, and I never drove to the hospital or anywhere when I was feeling off. That ruined sooo much of my life. Could no longer go anywhere, to my parents or son or friends or to a grocery store or pharmacy, or get a job that would require me to drive there (transit sucks where I live, and was offered jobs in other towns\/cities, but no way to get there). \n\nSo I've still done self-harm, but now I no longer call to get help to go the the hospital. I'm not really wanting to die right now, but I hate myself. I punish myself. But I can't actually die right now, because of my parents and my son. That will come later, when MAID is more accessible.\n\nAnyway, I have not left my bed or bathed in about six years -- okay, I do leave my bed when I go visit my parents in their care home. I've sharted my bed and don't care. I haven't done laundry. I don't clean my cat's litter box often enough. She poops on the kitchen floor and I don't care. Eventually I do clean it up. I DO feed my cat, and cuddle and talk and play with her on my bed.\n\nBut to get back to the point, people keep letting me down. Friends and family are oh-so-busy with their lives, like out for dinner, or dealing with their nannies, or away on vacay, or whatever. I don't whine to them. In fact I'm always putting on the face with them, and can joke and make them laugh. That's me.\n\nBut if they ask, I tell them. Again, not all whiney, but I do answer their questions. Well, no matter what, people don't want to hear anything that may burst their perfect bubble.\n\nI'm going to stop right now, because this is turning into a novel. Sorry that it's so long.

I've been depressed since I was 14 and am currently 40. I've tried several medications, TMS, and have seen a couple of therapists.\nAbout two years ago, I started getting pretty bad insomnia. Around the same time, I started becoming quite emotional. I don't remember the last time I cried prior to this happening, but the tears came during the holidays. I was alone and they just came out..and continued to come out. I struggled to watch movies or listen to music because they made me cry. Things stayed this way for about 8 months.\nIn August, I emailed my boss and told her I thought I was burnt out. She asked me to visit with her and I did. She was nothing but kind during our conversation. She agreed with me in that I am depressed and she recommended I try talking to a professional.\nMy 40th birthday was in September. It was easily the worst day of my life. I wish I had ended it then and there and still regret not doing it. I met with my boss again and completely broke down in her office. I took the rest of the week off.\nThe holidays were really bad. I spent two weeks alone and ultimately came to a solid conclusion that I don't matter. I'm not an important part of anyone's life and no one needs me. I cry all of the time. I go to work with a smile on my face and pretend as best I can while I'm there. I cry in the car, when I'm on a walk, and at home. I spend much of my weekend in bed. \nI don't know what to do at this point. My contract ends in June.

I will post this as a one-taker.\n\nIm new to this community and not very familiar with the rules here, so im sorry if i will do anything inappropriate. I would like to tell you about my life and the struggles i've been facing and probably still have to face. To be honest im desperate for a cure. \n\nIt all started since I was a child. Every time when I was excited about something my heart would start to pump extremly and I could feel the anxiety, but since I was a child and everything was all good it wasnt a problem at all. I didnt pay any attention further to it.\n\nIt became bad and a real problem when I was in the 11th grade. There was one girl in my class and I simply couldnt stop to think about her and by that I mean it in sick way I couldnt stop thinking about her. I became obsessed to a point where I had the illusion that i love her. My mind simply wouldnt stop  it was truly horrible the anxiety and the heart pumping came just a few times but I hat a horrible time with my mind, no matter what I tried I hat no control. It was 24\/7.\n\nIn school I always an okay student. Never good, but good enough to pass the exams, but when I had my finals in the 12th class, about three weeks ago, the anxiety the heart pumping and the 24\/7 ponder came to another level. I couldnt eat, I wasnt able to stop thinking, I had extreme anxiety. I know it probably didnt sound that bad but trust it was far worse than it sounds, it was pure hell for me. However I did pass the exams, even if never had experienced such a hoffiric time. But I did not knew what was about to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter school I took a year off. I had no Idea what I want to do with my life and who I want to be. I kinda forgot about the problems I was facing because If there was nothing that stressed my this hard, I was living a normal life. The struggles still hit me a few times because of the girl, I had no control over it.\n\nI started to take driving lessons, where I live driving school is an extrem expense and very strict as well. My Instructor told I was a good driver (which instructor would tell his student that he is a shit driver before an exam lol) and I was confident to pass the driving exam. Spoiler: I failed after two minutes. I was devastated at first, but I had no idea what would come. I was unemployed so I was just sitting at home all the and also because of covid I had very few social activities and didnt saw my friends often. My mind wasnt giving me break. I was pure horror, 24\/7 I was thinking about how I failed, I couldnt eat anything, I couldnt sit still, my heart was pumping all the time 24\/7. At this time my parents realized that something is wrong, I heard them talking about me, they said something like: \"remember he is sick child\". I was in hell and I was getting no break, mental and physical. The next appointment for driving school was in one month. But spoiler: I failed again, another dumb mistake. Everything i described simply became worse. It became more darker, I got scared about life. And I didnt catch a break 24\/7 mental problems, no eating, only pondering. At this time we had a an extrem lockdown and nearly everything closed. I went to the doctor and told him about my struggles, he only gave me the tipp to practise mindfulness. I had to change the driving school because a lot of the staff did quit after the lockdown. Also I had to wait 9 months. I was in a bad state in about 3 months but the last 4 wear okay. At the end I passed, it didnt feel goog and for sure was hard, because I had to show the new school that I was able to do the exam (they wanted me to wait and take more lessons), however I showed them that Im able to pass.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was about 3 Years Ago. It never became  so bad again  like the time when I was in driving school. Im currently doing my bachelors in mechanical engineering and I want to take more driving licenses, I think that I need to do this, but every day I know it can destroy me. I want to be stronger but I have no idea how. Im just tired at this not knowing when the next time will be where im at this state.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you very much for reading\n\nThis was my story\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","Score":2,"Total_comments":1}

I have no family history of mental illness besides OCD.\n\nI used to be the most outgoing guy ever and now I am scared to go out because I think I ruined my brain and anything will create a psychotic break. I am truly scared I have ruined my brain beyond repair and I will snap, lose my girlfriend, my life, my relationship with my parents, and my friends. I feel like I have been incredibly blessed my entire life for me to just fuck it up and ruin it by toasting my brain with drugs.\n\nI was recently diagnosed with OCD but I have had the tendencies my entire life and this bad high really brought it out and was even hospitalized for it in the past due to the extreme anxiety (unrelated to this story).\n\nSo, this happened about 3 months ago right after finals I wanted to relax so I got high, I had to pass drug tests for my co-op, so my tolerance was very low, and I took more than I normally do and I was also high alone in my college apartment which is never the case.\n\nI was playing COD with my buddies online. I took way too much edible (120 mg) and this made me very anxious and also took 200 mg of caffeine of reign. So, then I thought I heard something, and I ripped my headphones off, and it sounded like my neighbors\/someone in the hallway, but I was so high that it made it sound like it was in my apartment.\n\nThis made me super anxious, because I thought what I was hearing was not real. Then my friends got off and I stayed on because I was super anxious that I would hear something and I wanted them to stay on because I thought I was going to hallucinate and hear something not real when I took my headphones off. Then when I eventually did take my headphones off I was so tired and anxious.\n\nThis led to me hearing what sounded like intelligible whispers and this made me freak out into a panic attack, because I thought I was in psychosis. My tinnitus was so bad (always is when I am high) that I couldn't tell where I was coming from but it sounded like my air purifier. I went to sleep and felt completely normal the next day until I googled schizophrenia symptoms and now, I am very anxious about getting it.\n\nNow I get visual distortions like objects moving back and forth when I am very anxious and other visual distortions (nothing that isn't real only when I am very anxious about schizophrenia) and I hear voices in white noise (nothing that means anything, commands anything, causes delusions or legible in general) and only occurs when I am very anxious, alone, and trying to listen intently if I am hearing anything (so hyperfocusing on noises\/silence\/anything).\n\nThis has made grad school near impossible this semester and I am struggling under the stress of school and this stupid crap I should have never done.\n\nSorry, that is a lot, but I do not think like that anymore. Do I have any reasons to be concerned at all?? Is this normal? I am sorry, I just wish I never got high, and I am scared I screwed up my mind and my career. Yes, I am **NOT** getting high EVER again.\n\nOnce again, my pcp, psych, and therapist are **NOT concerned but I am**. This anxiety has been extreme because I am so scared of schizophrenia.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I had trips to hospital for bleeding from places you just shouldn't and all sorts, but nothing came of it.

We had a lot of great times but his disease progressed and the last year was absolute hell. I totally lost trust in him and he became very angry and selfish. We did the whole cycle of break up make up and it really took a toll on me. Went no contact 3 months, he contacted me, he was loving at first but when I told him I just need some stability and  if he wants it I will help him he turned very mean and he said such cruel things lashing out at me that I can never forget them. I was so hurt. I have blocked him and have zero hope for reconciliation which is a good thing. He's consumed and changed and that's not what I can be around. I try not to take it personally. Alcoholism is a bitch.\n\nI've spent 21 years raising kids, they are basically grown and on their own now and this was supposed to be my year. We were supposed to be looking for houses together. In another state. The whole house in the woods with the goats dream. And I'm actually financially ready now, with the ability to have it. I was so close. But instead it's like I've lost all of the things that made me happy, I lost my future plans, we had so many common interests like camping and motorcycles and cooking. I am lonely, I miss physical intimacy. And I worry obsessively about him (yes I'm reading codependent no more). I miss his family intensely, they loved me a lot. I used to bake all their birthday cakes. I was prepared to take care of his parents at the end if their lives. My entire life changed dramatically.\n\nAdditionally, my best friend has stage four cancer and is living with me. Things are going OK now but that's not easy and I just feel so radically not in control of my emotions or my life anymore. \n\nI'm seeing a therapist every other week, I recently went to a psychiatrist to get anxiety medication which I try to take very sparingly like a couple times a week . So I feel like I'm white knuckling it. I go to Al-Anon meetings and I talk to friends and I go to work and I am trying to eat right and to go for walks. Self help books. I pray. But I feel like I'm not making much progress. I'm very sad and very weepy every day.\n\nI'm having a hard time reconciling normal grief and normal valid depressed feelings based on everything I've been through and feelings of loss and fear, processing big traumas, versus maybe a medication would help me stabilize my thoughts and my moods so that I could get over this hump \n\nMy big fear is that it will take away the Low lows but also will prevent me from feeling high highs. I want to feel naturally happy again which I have not felt in a really long time. I have felt completely detached from most things that used to be important to me. Admittedly, like a an alcoholic gets their dopamine bursts from alcohol, I got my fix from being with him. Now my source of that is gone.  So I guess sadness is appropriate. But I have been feeling nothing but sad and anxious for three months. Frankly, I'm fragile.\n\nAt what point should I try a medication or is it healthier for me to live this very human experience and process it without? \n\nI'd like to just get out of the constant fight or flight emotional state so that I could see things much more clearly and practically. I'd like to focus my energy towards that. Has anyone experienced this, taking medication temporarily to kind of reset your brain, ease the thoughts, refocus? ","Score":1,"Total_comments":2}

Also, I'm not a native English speaker so my English could be pretty weird.\n\n\\---\n\nWhere should I begin?\n\nI'm a nearly 18-year-old girl who is having some troubles with my life and wants to end it.\n\nSince I was studying in primary school, my parents had started to make a lot of money. They were busy and merely had no time to take care of me as well as my two older brothers. I was often left sleeping alone by myself when my parents had to go on business trips. My brothers were not so much older than me so they didn't look after me, either. \n\nAs my parents were busy with their jobs, there was no one to take me to my friends' houses so often. I spent most of my time alone, playing with myself, and my plushies, and reading any book that I found in my house. As time passed, I developed an imaginary world where I could hang out with my imaginary friends (that came from my favorite comic books). I talked less to my real-life friends at school and spent more time on my imagination.\n\nThings kept going on that way until the time I reached 7th grade. My scores at school were awful. My mother noticed that and had a female home tutor to help me with Math and Physics. One day, my History teacher at school misunderstood me and said something that made me feel totally upset. Then, when I was studying with my home tutor, I kind of made a mistake and she asked me why or something like that. I don't remember exactly what she said, but it made my sadness greater than ever, and I couldn't control my feelings anymore. So I exploded like a bomb and cried continuously for more than 1 hour. \n\nThat was the day when my parents realized I was having some serious mental illnesses, so they took me to see a therapist. I did a test to see how depressed I was, and I almost reached the level of severe depression. My family decided to have me healed without taking any depression medicine. My parents changed my school, from a public one to a private one. That did help me with my mental illness a bit as I have some more friends. \n\nAfter a while, I reached 10th grade. There was a quarantine due to Covid-19, so my first semester was only spent studying online. I only made one friend in my new class, and we were not even so close. My social anxiety started to develop stronger than ever as I spent most of my day in my room. If not studying, I definitely was scrolling through some social media platforms. \n\nAfter my parents found out that I had depression, they stopped working as hard as before and spent more time at home. A few years later, an economic crisis hit my country, so they couldn't make so much money anymore. Until now, my family is still under the pressure of finance.\n\nThe thing is that, as we need to save money, I (kinda) have to get a scholarship to enter a university, in a major that I might be good at but not so passionate about it. This is the one that stresses me out the most.\n\nI actually don't have a passion for anything, I don't even do my hobby so often. I'm also a person who cannot be under so much pressure, so I hate to work and would switched off if I have to multitask. I hate growing up so bad. I'm confused about everything. I don't know what to do after I have finished high school. Growing up is too hard for me. The more days I try to live, the sadder I feel.\n\nConsequently, I just desperately want to end my life. If I die, maybe the financial pressure my family is undergoing will be better, and I will be much happier too as I get to do what I really want. I have planned to suicide the next Sunday, and I won't tell anyone about it. I will just act normal, like every day, so no one would notice. \n\nThis post is written (very) clumsily. Sorry for that.\n\nTLDR: I'm sad and going to end my life. Help me if you like.","Score":4,"Total_comments":4}

I feel like every single action I take is judged by others, and this has been happening since my teenage years. For example, I've only been to a club three times, and the constant judgment from others, or what I perceive as judgment, has prevented me from having fun and experiencing things my peers and friends had much earlier. When I look in the mirror, all I see is an ugly, stupid idiot who can't even pass university exams despite his efforts. I've never been in a relationship, never been kissed, and I'm afraid of being alone forever. Two years ago, I had a falling out with my few remaining friends, and we hardly talked for a whole year. We resolved things, but I'm still angry inside about some things. I know I've made mistakes, but their response wasn't fair. I'm tired, really tired. I feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders, and every step I take is judged by everyone. My parents are phenomenal people, and I love them dearly, even though they have their problems. Of course, I've never talked to them about this. I don't know if they know, but at 23, not having brought home a girlfriend, surely someone has noticed.

I think I'll go crazy. I reach a point where I curse.","Author":"BloodyDonuty","Timestamp":1709478690000,"Text":"Well, I'm over 30, and I can say I grew up as a typical everyday kid in the countryside, with a family that loved me a lot (those who are no longer here) and loves me a lot (those who are still alive).\n\nI live comfortably as I have an income, but nothing extraordinary. I'm looking for a job for two reasons:\n\n1) To have something to do.\n\n2) To have a higher income and live more comfortably.\n\nYes, I have a lot of free time, which unfortunately I don't enjoy at all. It might sound like a first-world problem, but... I SUFFER.\n\nWhatever I try to do (reading, music, movies, games), rarely brings me joy. Most of the time, when I try to do something entertaining, I get nervous, and annoying thoughts like \"why am I not having a good time? Why am I still restless? Should I do something else? Maybe I could enjoy my time better?\"\n\nSo, I've been living like this for the last 5-6 years (except for some occasional jobs I did). At this point, I would like to mention that I also had a long-term relationship with a very good and beautiful girl whom I decided to break up with just because... I got bored.\n\nMany would like to be in my position, but I just messed everything up (I don't regret it) because I just got bored.\n\nSo, am I alone? I suffer. I was in a relationship, still not having a good time. The worst part is that as time passes, I get anxious\/worried more easily because I'm not 20 or 25, and I know I'm aging. This has triggered my misery even more because I know people around me are aging, losing, building their lives (family, etc.), and this takes away the pleasure from enjoying my hobbies.\n\nMy mind constantly thinks, \"Oh, I see an interesting (MAYBE) movie. Should I do something else? Should I read a book, become more educated, maybe open new doors and experience new things?\"\n\nI read a book: I'm bored. Okay, I learn new things. And? Why should I care?\n\nThese are my personal issues. There are also others related to society and our existence. I think about how much misery there is in the world and how suddenly life can be destroyed. This probably makes it difficult for me to relax and enjoy because I fear some disappointment.\n\nAnother part of my concern is about death. I grew up as a typical Christian (not extreme). Rarely went to church, and fasting was limited. I know that terrible crimes were committed because of Christianity, but... I had hope that in the end, something good awaits me (if I go to heaven).\n\nI have lost my faith because I simply know that people can easily be misled or tell lies, etc. There are so many theories, myths, stories, religions, ideas where people believe they have the truth and the right. So, with this logic, why should I believe in Christianity?\n\nSo, not knowing what exists after death worries me. I have read very little about the simulation theory. I'm afraid that after death, there is simply hell for everyone, regardless of whether you were good or bad.\n\nMany find pleasure in getting married and starting a family. Others strive and aim for it. Well, even that seems stressful to me. Just the thought that I have to be careful and raise a child\/children gives me anxiety, and it feels like a burden.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, I'm over 30. I'm anxious because time is passing, and I'm aging. I fear starting a family, struggle to enjoy hobbies, and have existential concerns about what exists after death. These are my thoughts. Many times, sadness, anxiety, and boredom are so intense that I fear. I think I'll go crazy. I reach a point where I curse. I just curse (without wanting to) to release something. Besides being anxious and sad, I'm angry at how unfair life is.","Score":2,"Total_comments":1}

It started off small, basic things. Eat, sleep, sit in the sun, go to work. And slowly I got myself out of the house to socialize. Next thing I knew I was living. My heart still shattered but I was living again. And eventually I would meet my current husband. I don't think my ex ever loved me as much as my husband does. We have been together for 8 years now. Occasionally my ex pops up in my mind, but it's easier now. Because I can be logical. Love is an addiction, withdrawal is the outcome. But withdrawal in all its shittiness can be beaten with time.","Score":5,"Total_comments":0}

You aren't a pussy for confronting depressed feelings. But could I venture to suggest that taking your life is not proof of courage, it's unrealistic to have that idea of it, as though it was macho It's not courageous or not courageous - it cancels out everything.\u00a0\n\n\nI understand that you are completely worn out and you desperately need a break from existence. I know your life circumstances will be very different from mine but I have a few ideas.\u00a0\n\n\nFirstly, is there a chance that you're very young? Eg teens, twenties. On this sub, that's the highest traffic I see, for whatever the reason may be. Do I think that people in their 30s and upwards aren't depressed? Not at all. The reality is, I think, a lot of people who experience depression at a younger age to go on to continue to experience it in at least some forms m, during at least some times, throughout their lifetime.\u00a0\n\n\nCan it still be severe? Certainly.\u00a0\n\n\nBut, is it quite the same experience as the youngest people confronting depressed thoughts might tend to have? And, if not, might this offer some hope?\n\n\nI honestly think if you asked the older people here (assuming you are not among them), they would confirm they haven't magically been healed, they're still trying to find ways to live with their depression...\n*and*\nthat although many of us do feel nostalgia for earlier times, almost universally (there are exceptions) the average person with depression had a horrendous time during secondary school, around the approval to adulthood, and leaving school, the early 20s.\u00a0\n\n\nWhy might this be so, to the extent that thinking back to those times would seem radically different, even though one is still perhaps depressed at the current time?\n\n\nOh, so many things!\u00a0\n\n\nControl - people are often under their parents rooves while potentially severely at odds with them with no option\n\n\nSchool system\n\n\nNot old enough to legally vote, drink, etc\n\n\nRomantic or sexual experiences non-existent limited in scope\n\n\nPotentially restricted to an unsympathetic and alienating cultural locale\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe not relating to people of the same age or in the area\n\n\nGrowing up on social media (new kids) and comparing oneself to others\n\n\nLack of hope about future options based on economics\n\n\nHigh pressure to know exactly what you want to do in life, to choose, to commit and to perform\u00a0\n\n\nFriend groups breaking up, people moving away after school ends\n\n\nFear of not performing well in one-off exams, failing to get into tertiary education course or land job, failing course or getting fired\n\n\nEtc etc\n\n\nAre there still pressures when you're older? Absolutely and they can be brutal\n\n\nBut do they compare to that highly pressurised rite of passage kids go through when they're younger?\n\n\nLook, opinions will vary but I sincerely believe what a lot of people will tell you is they would never want to go back to that stage. We survived it and wouldn't trade places. .\n\n\nThis is a long way of saying that even if people don't magically transcend their symptoms of depression, it *does* get better. It almost certainly won't be quite as exquisite as you're experiencing it now.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd part of the reason for that is *you're still learning* , as we all are but maybe you're at the beginning, I sense I'm older than you anyway somehow, on average I'm older than the average post indicates.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat this means is that you likely do have capacity to get a better handle on these feelings than you are able to know now.\u00a0\n\n\nOf course you can't recognise it yourself, because it's yet to happen, so you can't realise it yet.\u00a0\n\n\nYour average older person who deals with symptoms of depression is not necessarily having an easy time, but, it's a lot more likely they've managed to learn a range of skills and tactics to help them get through the day.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's not easy, but in this way, I think I can sincerely say it must get easier, looking at how other older people here address younger people. It's not easy for them to have depression but arguably it's not the same experience they had when much younger - people grow a lot. There's lots of different rites of passage but you don't necessarily have that super concentrated high pressure of expectations Inna short timeframe. It becomes more abstract, for better or worse.\u00a0\n\n\nThis might not sound like I'm advocating for something to look forward to, but I know an intellectually dishonest approach probably won't work for you, you've probably had symptoms long enough that finding a way through isn't simply going to be a matter of clicking your fingers.\u00a0\n\n\nBut I think I can say to you with reasonable sincerity that it *is* going to change, *you're* going to change, in many ways you can't get anticipate. That *is* life and you can't experience this change if you don't hang around for it. I *am* saying it's not going to be just like it is now, on many levels, and I'd hope that would start by not thinking of yourself as a pussy by outgrowing such thoughts. Maturity is just one of those things that you can't figure out before experience changes you.\u00a0\n\n\nI hope this kinda makes sense and is vaguely helpful rather than just straight up alienating. I'm trying to say I think I can promise you it's not going to be exactly like this, the pain this exquisite in this way, forever. There may not be a magical escape from depression over the longer term, you might have to learn to try to \"manage the symptoms\". But there is very likely to be relief from the particular grief you are feeling right now.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd could any of us do anything to help you? I understand unsolicited advice can be the least helpful thing in the world. I'm just trying to extend a suggestion of hope which I think can be made in honesty. It won't sound ideal, but if I'm communicating decently enough, it should sound believable, real and achievable. What you have to do is survive. Change will come. It's not about being a pussy. It's putting one foot in front of the other until you manage to pass out of the toughest squeeze.\u00a0\n\n\nIf I made any problematic assumptions including about age, I apologise, please feel free to give me the heads up, I'm pretty tired and running on empty. I just hope you get some relief over the longer term man, and can reduce the level of torture\/self torture your mind is going through right now.\u00a0\n\n\nWishing you all the best.\u00a0","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

I totally remember Yahoo Answers and oddly, in a way, miss it - around long before AskReddit but when the internet wasn't quite so intense.\u00a0\n\n\nSome of those replies need editing but the phone interface makes it too difficult. I tend to write according to ideas - get the ideas out in a stream then look back to see how it went. Not necessarily compatible for the type of traffic here. Or very readable in general.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0I think generally if it's this sub I'm trying to think of what has substance beyond statements that could sound like platitudes. Any long term symptoms of depression might result in a frame of mind that's heavily resistant to any number of suggestions for various reasons.\u00a0\n\n\nOften my approach may not work for the average person and in the past, I think I've found the time and energy put into it thinking what might kickstart hope in a specific individual you don't know personally to be potentially very draining because often there isn't much feedback. You want to help but you can't tell if it did, that type of thing. I'm sure many of us here are predominantly silent one way or another.\u00a0\n\n\nAt the same time I usually feel for people who are clearly crying out for help where there is no response. See a lot of that here, and that's where I've seen you step in a lot of the time.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm almost certainly only here temporarily, and previously told myself I wouldn't come back here, for various reasons.\u00a0\n\n\nIt can be a fine balance, as I'm sure we can all appreciate, between a space which allows people not to worry about the stigma of depression and a space which can make everyone all the gloomier for encountering it.\u00a0\n\n\nThe thing is because of the way depression affects people, not everybody has the energy to support others while they're in need of support.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't know if I'm always the right person to help because this sub has always leaned young. Sometimes as an older person who lives with depression I feel like it's an obligation to try and help lift up younger people from the perspective of experience that things do change over time.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis being said, not that I use the subs like DatingOver30 etc, I do sometimes wonder if more specialised subs could help people find more relatable peers, or \"Mom for a minute\" where younger people can choose to approach an older person for advice.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's not my intention to be paternalistic but to look out for people who have gone through something I survived.\u00a0\n\n\nI think whatever I wrote here got downvoted, and this is a reasonable example of something that's somewhat discouraging for participation, because you don't know what that person's problem was. Maybe they had a good point that could be learner from, but if that was the case, I'd never know.\u00a0\n\n\nAs a result of this kind of thing, the long form when I think of ideas about how we can help people resolve something that seems relentless, and the low ability to edit on mobile, I ultimately will probably wander off from this sub again. (That's one of the reasons I thought I'd give you props while I still can.)\n\n\n\u00a0I know that in another 10 years people of the same age will be expressing very similar tortured thoughts and I just hope the younger people who are here now might in turn shared what helped them with those who are growing up with difficulty.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's just a bit of a tricky one, how to lift people up while you are down, how do you give sincere input that helps people feel better without intellectual dishonesty or repeating the same refrains. I think it's so important to do, but I also think it can be really hard and it's easy to feel you've not said the right thing or done enough.\u00a0\n\n\nWhich I think is exactly why a lot of people just back away from it altogether, and again, that's where the persistence of someone like yourself is so valuable.\n\n\nThanks for the lovely wishes and I wish you the same.\u00a0","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

Just try to improve on the aspects of yourself that you don\u2019t like, but don\u2019t put yourself down if you don\u2019t meet others standards. You need to find some friends that accept you for who you are. If they don\u2019t then they\u2019re not really friends. I have faith that you\u2019ll figure things out and find happiness. Just try to be patient and work towards your goals. Don\u2019t let setbacks ruin your motivation. I hope things get better for you soon.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

It\u2019s so hard to feel okay with anything or just being.\n\nI feel guilty over not doing or being enough. I don\u2019t have much motivation for anything, even though I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even that tired, and I don\u2019t end up doing much. I feel guilty over not doing more chores at home, like cleaning and such.\n\nI feel guilty because I\u2019m not working or volunteering and doing anything useful when I\u2019m a source of manpower. Even if I wasn\u2019t making money, I could go volunteer and maybe, hopefully be of help or use to someone or something.\n\nI feel guilty for having things or throwing away things. I hoard my old things because I\u2019m scared to waste them and throw them away, even if it seems unlikely I\u2019ll use them again or need them. From small trinkets to clothes that I don\u2019t need to things you would probably call trash (candy wrappers I keep as a souvenir, etc.) I keep almost all of it.\n\nIn fact, I feel guilty buying things and throwing away trash. I feel guilty that I bought something and it came with plastic wrapping I have to throw away. I feel guilty that that plastic is going to go into the landfill and wreck the earth. But I feel helpless to change that because I still selfishly want or need the item I bought. And because I succumb to my desire for convenience instead of trying harder to get around buying things with parts that go in the trash, like plastic wrapping or boxes, etc.\n\nI feel guilty that I consume food and am living here without difficulty when there are people starving and struggling, but I feel unable to save them or help them because if I donate recklessly, I won\u2019t have anything left for myself, even though I don\u2019t want to care about myself and think I\u2019m not that useful or worth it.\n\nI feel guilty for not responding to people and friends\u2019 messages for long periods of time. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t feel compelled to respond, for whatever reason. Maybe because I don\u2019t feel interested in much anymore. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not more interested in your life and who you are and what you\u2019re doing. I feel guilty for being a bad friend and not caring or responding earlier.\nI wanted to send letters to my friends but never did. I feel guilty for always making promises I don\u2019t keep. People tell me I can send them late, but even then, I feel guilty for also sending them late, and I feel that there\u2019s no solution.\n\nI feel guilty for not trying harder or making anything out of myself or possible skills. I used to do things like creative endeavors, writing, singing, drawing, etc. not just for fun but also because I wanted to be good and better at them. But I was continually caught up in perfectionism and my inability to meet my own expectations, so I ended up giving up on everything. I also have started learning languages but gave up or am not trying that hard to learn more even though it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have options or resources. \nI also exercised regularly for a while, but I gave up because I didn\u2019t feel motivated to do anything anymore and now I just laze around.\n\nI just constantly feel guilty for not doing or being anything good or enough. Even if you say that I don\u2019t have to be something to be enough, I can never escape this feeling. Meanwhile, I idly dream of success or being good at something, so much that others would admire me and look up to me. But it\u2019s all just impossible, or so I think, and at the same time, I hate that attitude because I don\u2019t even truly try. \n\nSorry for the long post if anyone read. \nTLDR; I feel guilty for everything that I am and I am not and don\u2019t do. I wish I was a better person but then don\u2019t actually try, which only makes me resent myself more.","Score":4,"Total_comments":1}

If so, imo relatively higher chance that conditioning is a factor, tho not saying being haunted with rumination is unique to girls\/women, just that the cultural conditioning can arguably increase susceptibility to guilt about other people's feelings as traditional conditioning teaches us to revolve around them, more or less. Not that you can necessarily tell given the capacity of a lot of women to act like total pr*cks (said as a woman and technically a feminist).\u00a0\n\n\nSo it's kinda potentially the worst of both worlds, guilt and pr*cks including the women. *Reminding myself this is a pep talk*\n\n\nBeing empathetic can be a good trait\nIt should be balanced because people will use you\n\n\nPeople say guilt is a useless emotion, I call bs, it totally has its place, culturally, in civilisation, for survival, it stops us from doing terrible things to each other, it creates change\u00a0\n\n\nBut, free floating guilt is obviously super corrosive and soul destroying\n\n\nWhat can be done to level with it?\n\n\nWell I'm a CBT skeptic for various reasons but honestly you could try \"challenging\" the thought. There's evidence CBT can actually *increase* rumination tho, based on my experience, I wouldn't personally recommend it\n\n\nYou can give yourself credit, that caring about people is good, you can consciously choose to keep that bit\n\n\nYou can try and observe when this isn't necessarily really caring about people and more like an obsessive tic that is just torturing you and observe it has no useless purpose. Similar to CBT I don't rate mindfulness but with this technique you would not resist the thought but just observe it and kinda accept it's something your brain does without necessarily feeding into it. Eg \"ok I notice I'm too tired to respond to Friend's text cos I can't hit the right tone, and straightaway I feel Friend thinks I'm a bad person'\u00a0\n\n\nPersonally I don't really find this radically helpful but I'd say to some extent as a tool it's a blunt instrument that can help you spiralling further into thoughts where you feel bad about feeling bad\n\n\nIf I have singular unsolicited depression advice as Old Person it's to avoid the snowball - feeling bad about feeling bad. Arguably that's where people start to lose their sh*t.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you can just keep it to feeling bad, this sounds terribly dystopian, but it's a lot easier to manage\n\n\nMaybe just maybe there's a touch of snowball in your thread. You feel guilty and then you feel bad about feeling guilty.\u00a0\n\n\nOne idea is to reduce it to feeling the incessant guilt without judging yourself that your brain is doing that, accepting it and trying to put one foot in front of the other despite the signal to noise ratio. Easier said than done, but practice is worthwhile\n\n\nAnother idea is this might be the kind of thing SSRIs or SNRIs work well for - but they might also blunt your affect\n\n\nAnother idea is to look into conditioning but if you're a woman and you opt for this, I strongly encourage you not to swing the the other extreme. There's a lot of post-empathy women on Reddit and I kind of saw how it developed? Read Jezebel... Cut off narc parents... Lurk on relationship subs as experts writing off total strangers instead of maintaining actual relationships of give and take. It's a very internet and almost age specific thing\n\n\nI hope there's a better middle ground for women than being pickled in the acid of non-productive free for all guilt and becoming your boundaries without offering anything much else in particular but opinion\n\n\nThis is a long way of saying conditioning could be a part of this if you're female, but I observe other people resist that conditioning in ways which seem extreme (although they've become common). Personally wouldn't recommend.\u00a0\n\n\nSorry this has such a depleted tone - I would feel guilty if I wasn't so tired, hehe\n\n\ntl;dr ~ IF you're a lady this MIGHT be part and parcel of conditioning and being depressed\n~ You can try challenging some thoughts and accepting others\n~ You can try to deal with the feelings rather than feeling bad about them in addition to stop snowballing\n~ You can think about conditioning\n~ You can try consciously affirming what you value and want to care about and make a distinction between that and autopilot guilt which isn't actually a real sign of caring perhaps but more like a tic that obviously isn't fulfilling any genuinely useful social or other person, and sort of think of that as more like a tic, while maintaining the guilt that functions to uphold your values and help protect your relationships etc\n\n\nHope this might provide a little relief from feeling alone with these thoughts for the time being - it would be interesting if someone has tried anything they found particularly useful or alleviating with this symptom\n\n\nRe gender see also culture eg certain cultures or cultural relationships might archetypally really set up guilt dynamics eg Trad relationship of Asian kids with parent\n\n\nHope this makes sense and wish you luck! A more upbeat version of this is out there somewhere, it just doesn't exist in my brain tonight. I feel bad as it were when some comments don't get responses. I'm sure people who post here are looking for interaction - so I hope it was better to read this than to have no comment at all \ud83e\uded6","Score":-1,"Total_comments":0}

Now it's all worse.\n\nMy question is, and I'm wondering if anyone feels the same, why does it feel easier to be cold to others than to be kind? I try talk to the least amount of people possible, I'm constantly serious, and I don't enjoy anything really. \n\nI do still care about people though, I just have to push myself hard to feel it, it's hard to explain, It's something I'm trying to understand. It's worse that I am studying to be in a field dedicated to helping people, and I'm struggling to even feel the love to help. I care about them, but I just can't feel it within me many times, it's like a complete numbness. Why? I'm trying to read moral philosophy but I just don't have enough time to read that much \n\nWhen I interact with people, I get this feeling in my heart which really bothers me. It feels easier to dismiss everyone and forget about people, to not rely on them for anything, and to only speak to them if they come to me. Sure I have nice conversations sometimes, but that's only because I have to i.e when I'm working.\n\nWhy is this happening? I've distanced myself for years from everyone who cares about me, and it feels easier to do that because as I said, talking to people bothers me, it's like I feel worse, a feeling in me trying to pull me back to be alone. I'm studying a lot right now, and being alone and cold is whats getting me through it. I can dismiss everything to continue my life, which I guess is what I did with my trauma for so many years until it all just came out.\n\nIm trying, I apologise if I said anything wrong.\n\nThank you, I read a lot of this community and it's really helpful.\n\n","Score":0,"Total_comments":0}

I'm back at almost rock bottom again.

I\u2019ve never had a crush before so I never know what to say.

I\u2019ve dealt with depression for 12 years now. Been on and off medication, currently off. \nWhere to begin? I am a Muslim (I feel like this is important info when reading below). Im 28 now. I live in the West. 7 years ago, I stopped believing in my faith and got into a relationship with a non Muslim who had a history with drugs. I got addicted to heroin. I dropped out of law school and left work. I lived with him for 6 years. Getting high. That\u2019s all life was about. We ended things and I moved back in with my family. \n\nMy dad sent me off to his third world country to get clean. I lived there for 1 year. I\u2019ve been clean for a year and a few days. I got married and divorced there (I didn\u2019t actually meet my husband, we married and divorced while he was in Europe). I\u2019m now back home and I see how much of my life I\u2019ve wasted. I\u2019ve lost my future. My sisters who are 23 and 25 are married, one with a son. Im the oldest and still living at home. It\u2019s extremely embarrassing in my culture because I have no excuse. I have met someone but we can\u2019t get married now for 2 reasons: I\u2019m still religiously married and he\u2019s overseas and so won\u2019t be able to do so until the end of the year (issue with accomodation). I know this gives me some reason to hold off but I don\u2019t think I can wait till the end of the year. The sadness and self loathing are so debilitating. Every hour feels like a month. \n\nI start a new job tomorrow and I really don\u2019t have the energy to even get up to shower. I have no money, not even $1 to my name. No car. \nI have no friends. None. I have 4 contacts (2 parents and 2 sisters). I actually mean it when I say I have no friends. I lost them all during my drug phase. My sisters and I don\u2019t talk, they\u2019re too busy with their lives now. My sisters didn\u2019t even bother to respond to me when I told her I was going through a divorce and feeling suicidal overseas.\n\nI\u2019ve lost all my parents\u2019 trust. My family life is really bad\u2026my parents are going through a divorce. Every time I try to improve my life (like finding a job), my parents discourage me and want me to stay home\u2026worried I will relapse. They let me find a job but I won\u2019t have control of my finances. I also can\u2019t leave the house without one of them accompanying me.\n\nI know I\u2019m completely to blame for being in this position, and I know I deserve it. Yet, I\u2019m still selfish enough to want to end it all. I know how I will go out. I OD on fentanyl before and it was exactly like falling asleep. I\u2019ll do the same but with heroin this time as fentanyl is extremely hard to get a hold of atm. I\u2019m waiting two weeks for 2 reasons: to receive a paycheck so I can make the purchase and to see if work provides with me some sense of identity and purpose. \n\nI\u2019m posting this as a form of catharsis. I\u2019m not looking for pity because I don\u2019t deserve it. I am an extremely heavy burden on my family. I dealt with the loneliness and sadness by getting high in the past but now I have nothing to make me feel better. So, in exactly 14 days I\u2019ll stop feeling.

I feel like I should just give up. People tend to say \"Oh, you're still young, you can travel, discover, party, etc.\", but if you think about it, it turns out to be not true. At college if your parents (or yourself) aren't rich, then you'll be stuck in a cycle of work that only varies between college work and part-time jobs. If you want to survive through this, you basically have to sacrifice all the happiness that could have awaited you in college due to living from paycheck to paycheck and writing essays after essays and doing assignments after assignments. There will be no room for meeting new people, making friends, travelling, etc. (you name it).\nAnd if you don't go to college it gets worse: Living from paycheck to paycheck because your 9-5 job doesn't pay you enough. Starting a new hobby? With what money? Personality alone won't grant you a chance to learn new skills\/things. Learning anything new is impossible without some sort of investment. And if you're not rich, you can forget it.\n\nI am the most miserable person that has ever existed. People tend to say nice things about me but I know it's not true. If it was, I wouldn't have been friendless and left out the whole time. If I could list some things about myself I could think of:\n\n* Stupid\n* Fat\n* Lazy\n* Incompetent\n* Egoistic\n* Cringe\n\nI honestly can't think of anything positive.\nI can't cook, drive, build up anything because my hands are not even capable of using a screwdriver properly. The only thing I (mediocricly (is that even a real word?)) can is to play video games all day and waste my time instead of going out there and putting myself to a challenge.\nMy personality is even worse. I can't even keep a conversation going for a minute before the person I'm talking to gets bored and walks off to talk with someone less cringe than me. I never had a girlfriend. I only had a crush on a girl in 9th grade but she was way ahead of my league. She dumped me and I still can't believe I was so stupid to fall in love in the first place.\nI can't even make any jokes about anything without everyone around me thinking that I was serious and acted defensive. I had a school trip for 5 days with my classmates and I ended up spending those 5 days alone, cause who likes someone who is boring af? I ended up spending the time alone and questioned myself whether I should just commit suicide and let it end. But I have my parents and siblings who love me and I don't want them to worry about it so I'll just try to activate my \"survival mode\". \n\nAnd for those who will say \"Seek professional help\", where I live atm (Germany) it takes almost a year to be able to start therapy, let alone 3 months in case of a crisis. The amount of therapist is so low that I feel inferior to those who have it worse. There are people who were raped or experienced some serious trauma and I'm here talking about being miserable. I'd rather give my therapy spot to someone who really needs it. I don't want to waste my therapist's time with my stupid problems.\n\nI just feel like I should have spent my childhood better. If it wasn't for my stupidity I would have already went to university and would have been proud of myself. But no. Here I am, the worst human being possible.","Score":0,"Total_comments":1}

Lately, I've been feeling like I might be dealing with depression, but then I start questioning myself. I tell myself it's impossible for me to suddenly become depressed, and maybe I'm just being overly sensitive and blowing things out of proportion.\n\nI keep thinking that because I'm a teenager, my feelings aren't real and are just a result of hormonal changes. It's like I'm convincing myself that I'm deluding myself with depression. At the same time, I know I should appreciate my life because there are so many people who would trade places with me in a heartbeat.\n\nI used to believe that we've become more sensitive as a society, but now I'm not so sure. Online, I see all these conflicting opinions about depression and self-improvement, and it's making me doubt my own beliefs and experiences.\n\nOne of the toughest parts is that I don't have anyone I can truly confide in or who understands what I'm going through. I can't even seek professional help, and it's weighing heavily on me. Plus, I feel this pressure because of my religious background, even though I'm not particularly religious.\n\nReligion holds significance in my life, though I'm not particularly religious. Suicide goes against the sanctity of life in my faith, which deters me from considering it. Despite not being deeply religious, these beliefs still influence my moral compass and deter thoughts of suicide.\n\nI just wish I had a real, trusted friend or family member to talk to, someone who gets where I'm coming from. And on top of it all, my dad's negativity and constant complaints are really getting to me. I miss the old him, the happy days with genuine friends and a loving family.\n\nI've also noticed I've forgotten about the things I used to love, like hobbies and habits. And these endless headaches and burning eyes are driving me crazy. It's like I have tears in my eyes, but they won't come out, almost like my pride is holding them back.\n\nI know it's a lot to unpack, but I'd really appreciate your thoughts and advice on this.

That's why I'd like to hear some input from you, since I usually get insightful comments from kind Redditors. Thank you to anyone who reads this!\n\nI am diagnosed with a severe recurring depressive episode and am taking antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics. The last episode was extremely difficult for me, so I decided to slow down regarding University courses. Basically, I only enrolled in those courses I feel I can handle, and I'll take the rest next year after I take some rest, let the medicine do its thing, and focus on improving my mental and physical health.\n\nBut I'm feeling overwhelmed by stress because of a workshop I'm involved in. It's an assignment for one of my courses at Uni. I study psychology, with a focus on educational psychology. For this workshop, my friend and I will be conducting a workshop with high school students about mental health content and self-diagnosing through social media. I really enjoy the creative process, but I'm terrified of the actual presentation. I don't feel prepared for it right now. I find myself overthinking every detail and never feeling satisfied with my work. On top of that, I have other worries that are distracting me from focusing on the workshop (a recent painful breakup, a bad financial situation, loneliness, uncertainty about the apartment where I'm a tenant, family situation). There are other activities that uplift me more (reading, cleaning, self-care, hanging out with friends), and I feel like I don't have the motivation for the workshop at the moment because it's causing me too much anxiety. I feel guilty about it because it might seem irresponsible, but I intentionally slowed down to focus on my health and find peace, which isn't happening because of the workshop. After one situation that recently triggered me, I also feel that my symptoms have worsened slightly again.\n\nI'd like to help my friend with the workshop's execution and complete what I started, but without putting myself through the stress of presenting. I'm willing to accept the consequences of that decision, and it would at least allow me to contribute something while avoiding the stress of the performance. Should I tough it out and go through with the presentation? Or would it be better to step back to reduce my stress? And if so, how should I communicate this to my professor? (I talked to her before about my depression, and I just keep avoiding and prolonging assignments in her courses, so I feel like she might start thinking I'm lazy or irresponsible).\n","Score":0,"Total_comments":0}

However, I can give you some advice because I was in the same situation at 13 and I also have had to deal with the effects of covid on a teenager. First of all, assuming your in middle school, it fucking sucks for everyone, of course worse for others, but everyone is just starting to experience certain emotions and bodily changes which causes a lot of awkward moments. My freshman year of high school was my year after Covid and I was extremely awkward too and I still am a lot of times but in general it has gotten a lot better just through at least putting in the bare minimum to speak to people normally on a daily basis. Moving on to love, you are 13, not you or anyone your age knows what it really is, it's the same for me. Now I personally know that can be hard to believe or accept as a fact but in today's society people are expected to have been with someone or be in a relationship younger than ever. My mom (56), did not have her first boyfriend till her freshman year of college and that was similar with people around her. I long for affection too but I just have to realize that I'm thinking about love like the young kid that I am. On to bullying, I have been bullied quite frequently too and it is one of the most draining things possible to experience.  I know I am going to probably sound cliche here but 90% of the time the people that are bullying you are doing it because they feel insecure about something in their life and cope with it through bullying other people. Even in the rare occasion that insecurity is not the reason, you have to realize who gives a fuck what some regular ass other human beings thinks about you. Every man is made equal that person is another human being like you and there is nothing by nature making them any more important or better then you. Grades, I had phenomenal grades until covid but now in high school I have struggled to pass through every grade. But the real kicker is that it doesn't really fucking matter as long as you pass. I would encourage you to just get by and graduate through standard education but if you feel that dropping out once you are of legal age would make you happier and improve your life, make a plan for what you will do and try your hardest to make your parents to understand. Happiness, I struggle to find happiness too and so does every other living being, I used to think I would never experience it but I have in up and down moments. But that type of happiness leaves you feeling empty because it so constantly comes and go's. Real happiness is finding something you love to do and doing it as much as you can. Find something that makes you happy it could be anything, whether its playing guitar, astrology, or making rubber band balls, and don't let anyone shit on you for this or tell you that you are wasting your time. At the end of the day, you are extremely young you have barely just started to experience life and have much to learn just as I do. We are all trying to find our way through this weird expierence called life.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

Even for an experienced psychiatrist, finding the right antidepressant for you is trial and error.\n\nI first had escitalopram, but it killed my libido. Then I had sirtraline, but it had no effect on me whatsoever, it was like I was taking water. \n\nThen I took venlafaxine for quite a long time. Well that was interesting, because it made me have very vivid dreams with a feeling of boundless power, wow, I miss those dreams. But those become less after a while, and instead you get brain zaps. It's difficult to describe the feeling - maybe like water balloons exploding in your head. They are pretty annoying. It was also a pain to get off venlafaxine - I had to do it very slowly over a period of several months, and even after I stopped it I got an occasional brain zap for a while. Not anymore though.\n\nNow I'm on quetiapine and it works best. It's really good at keeping me in a good mood. It also makes me sleep longer and deeper. As such, not a bad side effect, but if I don't plan enough time for sleep, it's very hard to wake up in the morning. Definitely not planning to stop with this one any time soon, but should try to go to bed earlier.\n\nAnyway, there is no way to tell in advance what will work best for you.

","Author":"DuckGroundbreaking56","Timestamp":1709408157000,"Text":"I've been in chronic pain for the last 5 years that effects my entire body. It's a constant pain and I've been doing everything I can to find a diagnosis. Its only gotten worse overtime and I still dont know why it's happening. It started on the right side of my body in my face and my skull, then down my neck and back. After some years I began suddenly  feeling extreme pain in my right testicle and I couldn't walk the same anymore. The pain has never went anyway since then and its constant. Overtime my condition has gotten worse. Now both sides of my body hurt and I can no longer sit, walk, or lie down without hurting extremely badly. I always need to sit or lie on a pillow or I just cant do it, and I can only stand for a little while before it hurts too much. My life is very miserable. Due to my condition its difficult to near impossible for me to work. As well it's made it difficult to do anything outside. It's made my life very sedentary.\n\nIt's hard to make friends like this. I haven't had a friend or a relationship in this entire 5 years. I haven't got a single person I could talk to other than my grandma. I'm also homeless. My family doesn't understand my condition or the ways it affects my mental health. I have an abusive family who kicked my out to the street when I needed them the most. I've been living in my car for the past 8 months  and I'm pretty much confined to the inside of the car due to my pain. I spend long weeks without seeing anyone, sitting in my driver's seat in serious physical and emotional pain for long hours. I have no money to do anything, and even if I did, I still would be very limited in what I can do. So friendships are just off the table. Considering I'm unemployed, homeless, cant walk and I have to carry a pillow everywhere I go just to sit. I've completely given up on love. Plus, any kind of sexual experience would be very very painful one, as my groin hurts the worst. Not that I would ever get that far, I'm completly worthless and no one would ever want to date me. Literally just a nobody carrying around a dirty pillow without a future. I have no family and no friends. And considering all of the facts, I'm likely to never be healed from my pain.\n\nSo, this year I'm giving it one more go with these doctors. I'm gonna try my best to get healed, but if I cant, then I'm just going to end my own life. Hanging or intentional drug overdose. I've put in a lot of thought and planning into this, and I think it's for the best. All I'm doing is suffering and I'm nothing but a burden. I'm always lonely and depressed. Physical pain and stress are just constant. I feel really bad for my grandma and my mom. But I cant live like this anymore. I wish so badly that I never existed. Suicide is my only way to find relief. Its my only tool of completely healing all of my issues in one swoop. It actually brings me some sense of joy when I think that my life will end soon. I really dont want to be in pain anymore. My entire day is filled with pain. I'm entirety convinced that I wont be healed, but pushing this last year will make a difference to me and my family. To think that at least i gave it one last good go before I said goodbye. I'm not even sure I can wait a whole year to do it but, i guess we will see what happens. Either way, death is really deep in my mind. I wish I was never born and I cant wait till I can finally kill myself. ","Score":10,"Total_comments":3}

I am having faith that it reaches the right people who it will be of aid to and give them a sense of empathy. There is a quote that says \"the truth is harsh,\" and I quote another I once heard, which is, \"Life moves on, people haven't got time for your problems.\" Except I beg to differ, because at the end of the day when everything's said and done everyone is important and everything you're feeling is valid, every hardship your facing is worth an applause for, and every time someone ever told you, you were less than the minority they were very wrong. Everyone is facing challenges some more than others, but don't let feelings of worthlessness or self-criticism destroy your heart. Society says you should always put on a mask and pretend to be alright all of the time when in reality it's alright to not feel alright all the time, what isn't alright is to feel like you're not important and to feel like your emotions aren't important. Because they are. The reason I'm saying all this is because it genuinely grieves my heart to see other people suffering or barely getting by. I used to and occasionally do still suffer with depression although it used to be a lot worse. You aren't alone. I also suffer from PTSD and other things. No matter what you've been through or who you are, don't let the dimness in this world bring your light down or take it away from you. Hold onto it because you are loved.

It's so sad how people individualize issues like depression, BPD, CPTSD, etc. So much.\n\nI have spent all of my life being screamed at and shamed for simply existing.

I straight up pass hours of my day just fantasizing about having someone to cuddle me, pet my hair, squeeze me with a tight hug, say how much they love me, comforting me when I feel sad. It's not even something sexual, it's just this internalized and totally justifiable longing for a mother figure. People always talk about daddy issues this, daddy issues that, but they don't even think how absolutely hurtful it is to feel like the person who put you into this world don't really loves you, only the image of you she has in her head maybe. But not the true, separate-individual-not-an-extension-of-her you.  \n  \nI really don't want to kill myself, but when things get bad I always have this constant feeling that I am only a couple bad days away from doing it. It just feels like my inevitable ending. I actually can feel good about things, I feel good when I watch a good movie, when I read a good book, when I wake up and I see a particularly beautiful sunrise, when I listen to some good music. I feel hopeful when things in my life get a bit better, when I don't feel so isolated from other people. But none of that matters if every little seed of happiness I try to sprout is crushed down by the shitty people I have around in my life. I am 16, can't move out and honestly don't know if I'll have the courage to move out and never see them again because everything in my country is about family. None of that matters if I still feel this almost physical sensation of emptiness, if I feel like bad for months straight, then get better for a couple weeks and then be shoved right into that same dark place I was again. None of that matters if I feel ashamed of just existing.  \n  \nIf I had someone who actually cared, who gave me at least one example of someone loving me so my mind can shut the fuck up about me being unlovable, I would in fact feel fine.

When I went through it before I was generally miserable, but I experienced a lot of negative emotions - not because I couldn't experience pleasure, though. The negative ones just dominated and it was also related to life circumstances to one degree or another almost every time. \n\nBut now, it's not that I feel depressed, I just don't feel positive emotions anymore. It started with not enjoying music anymore. I thought it was bizarre, because I've always loved music, this was a first. Then.. I noticed that positive feelings were subdued in general. Not gone, but they were more mental than physical. Normally I can feel emotions in my body, but it was like they were really subtle, and when I enjoyed anything, it was a cerebral thing, rather than feeling it palpably internally. Then eventually things started being noticeably less pleasurable, and sometimes nothing is really interesting at all. And things aren't that funny anymore. My body will automatically laugh or smile at something that would normally invoke it in me, but the actual feeling is barely there. There's just this flatness. The only emotions I feel strongly are boredom, dread when I have to do boring things or things I don't like, frustration, and anger. Boredom and dread is what I feel the most. It's miserable. The only thing that's noticeably pleasurable anymore is the taste of food. It's all I look forward to, and it makes me eat past the point of being full. \n\nThe only thing that I can think of that this might be linked to is being physically ill - I have several chronic illnesses, and not everything wrong with me physically is explained by a diagnosis yet either. Nothing has changed in my life since this started, aside from the fact that I keep acquiring more health issues over time and my life generally isn't great to begin with because of that. Maybe my poor health has finally extended to my brain (well, it technically already has, in the form of cognition issues), and now my neurochemistry is fucked too. I really hope this isn't permanent, because it absolutely sucks.\n\nI just wanted to post here because I don't have anyone to talk to about this who gets it. I only have one friend I'm close enough to talk to about this sort of thing, and she told me to watch videos of puppies and look at pictures of nature.. as if that's going to make me feel anything either (it didn't).

Why would i keep putting in everything i have, when i never have anything to show for it? Whats the purpose?

I cant even enjoy the movies anymore. \n\nAfter 29 years of failure, rejection, being thrown away, over and over again, and getting nothing out of anything, i dont know why i should even continue to try?

I\u2019m trying to fix my life and started college again. There\u2019s so many things I want to do: travel, paint, try dancing lessons, etc. But I have to be honest, after 10 years of depression (and clearly still struggling) I\u2019m such a piece of shit human. To start off, I\u2019m a huge introvert and struggle a lot with carrying conversations with people. I\u2019ve always been like that since I was a kid. I\u2019ve always been a weird loner kid at heart and struggled making friends. I\u2019m broke as hell to do any of the things I desire or to have any real hobbies or live without family. I can\u2019t be taken seriously by people I date because I am the most boring person on earth (no hobbies, I have trouble being social and expressing myself, etc). Sometimes I just don\u2019t see the point of being here at all. I know my life is improving and that I\u2019m young, but every time I try to date it slaps me in the face how unlikeable I am and how much people dismiss me.\n\nI guess I\u2019m seeking some kind of advice on how to fix my personality after being depressed for so long. \n\n[P.S. Want to hear something funny? I tried starting therapy and made the appointment for February the 14th since I wasn\u2019t doing anything anyways. The therapist cancelled on me the night before.

None of the supposedly bad traits about yourself that you listed are actually bad traits.  They're neutral, and that's just who you are, that's not what boring is, at least in my opinion.  You even listed fun desires that you have, like travel, painting, and dancing.  There's nothing wrong with who you are.  Also, lots of people are having financial trouble, especially at 27, so don't feel bad about that.  I do understand how it limits your possibilities though, like traveling too far.\n\nI think going back to school is a good idea (I plan on going back.. for a third time).  I recommend going for something that you enjoy and have an interest in, but that also is somewhat useful for getting a real job\/career that interests you.  My biggest mistake was doing a job I hated just because it was easy and paid well.  Life is empty if you spend so much time doing something that you hate.\n\nEmbrace who you are, and be fair to yourself.  If someone else doesn't like it, that's their problem, not yours.  Go do those things that you want to do.  If you can't afford dance lessons, start with painting.  Be yourself and live genuinely.  Best of luck.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I've always been alert. I haven't had a single peaceful sleep in a long a while. I started crying like a baby daily (crying wasn't that much of a trait of mine. The smallest inconvenience can bring tears to my eyes. The past two months was months of utter horror. I also experience a very radical and violent shift in the way I view suicide. 2 months ago I was planning to commit suicide: I stood there by my fav bridge. I texted my friends and they begged me not to do so. I suddenly realized how big it was (for them) and how much it'd hurt them. I'd always joked abt it and had always been careless\u2014I was stupid, I was selfish.\nI exchanged a convo with one of them and she told me how much she loves me and I started sobbing, crying and breaking down really hard non-stop. I still somehow don't feel loved and always feel lonely tho. \n\nI suffer from extreme anxiety\u2014and currently particularly about what if my dad one day gets fed up with my \u201ctoo-feminine-for-a-man\u201d hair and cut it while I'm asleep and against my will. I sure if he ever tries during the day I will fight him. But what if he betrays me? I can absolutely do nothing abt it beforehand. And he's been treating me a lil but well and decently lately mainly because he doesn't want to affect ny concentration on my studies. But everything is still possible yk. I can't ignore any kind of possibility, especially since he once joked abt cutting it a year ago. I also had 2 traumatic experiences related to my hair\u2014all were had something to do about my school's hair policies. He never supported me in each situation. I had to cut it and that ruined my mental health and affected it very badly. And the thing is: I know if this ever happens again I'll lose my sanity, the thought of it is just very horrifying and scares the shit out of me. I avoid thinking abt it especially in practical terms so that I don't feed my anxiety.\n\nI'm also I'm a 12th grader and i only have 3 months left before my exams on (Chemistry, Biology, Geology, Physics) and my grades will determine which college I'll get into. I have no hope though, I've wasted the past 6 months studying very inefficiently due to mental health and my atypical way of studying\u2014my efficiency dropped so badly recently.\n\nI don't wanna live anymore. I'm tired and nobody gets it. I'm only here because my friends potentially care abt me. Suicidal ideation used to comfort me that sooner or later I'll end it, but now that that shift happened I feel like I'm trapped and stuck\u2014whenever i think abt it i remember how my friends will be hurt.

I'm stuck.","Author":"ThisIsNotMyBrain","Timestamp":1709436775000,"Text":"*TLDR: I'm struggling very badly with my mental health but meds take away my imagination and creativity entirely (I'm an artist and need it as my job).*\n\nI'm in my 30s and I'm back once again living with my family because I can't function like a normal person, and because of how bad my mental and physical health are I also can't manage a normal job. I've also been having such enormous amount of stress and anxiety for many years now I fear my heart might give up at any moment if I keep on going like this, and the rest of my diagnoses do not make it any easier on me.Lately my OCD has been beating me up so badly, most of the time I can't even fall asleep from all the constant unrelenting horrible thoughts. I'm going through the day half asleep and so out of it I sometimes can't even form coherent sentences. When I do get sleep, it's so poor and I wake up so many times I never get to feel rested. PTSD is also relentless.\n\nI have been working on making art my full time job. The problem is, whenever I've been taking meds, they have always taken all my creative thoughts out of my brain and it makes it pretty much impossible to work on anything. Once I stop taking them, my head starts to slowly clear up after a few days until I can eventually draw again. This has sadly cost me many years of not being able to do my job properly.At first my previous psychiatrist didn't quite believe the meds could take away my creativity, but it has happened every single time with all the different meds they have given me. My current therapists have acknowledged it and know it as a fact, and I've heard about other artists, or even book authors, struggling with the same issue whenever they had to get on medication, making it very hard or near impossible to accomplish their jobs.\n\nI recently started doing very poorly with my mental health again, I'm in a very dark place and it's affecting my (already poor) physical health, so my therapists have decided it's best I get back on yet another different medication.I was ready to start taking it, but the day I was about to do so I started freaking out so much about the side effects (I always struggle a lot when starting or dropping from meds and get the worse side effects) but mostly the fact that it will be almost impossible to get any art done, let alone keep making it work as my job. And so for two weeks now, I've been so anxious at the thought of taking the meds, it's even taking my sleep away (as if I needed more things in my head).I know worrying about the meds side effects doesn't help, but after trying so many different medications I know exactly how it's going to affect my art, and after so many long breaks from my art it freaks me out so much to get onto yet another break and not be able to make a living for myself.\n\nI feel like a failure, useless, keep spiraling down and never seem to get better. I haven't accomplished anything in life other than art.I'm working on getting some disability help, but even if I manage to get some help, I would still need to work to somewhat make a living. And so that's why I'm struggling so hard with my meds situation.I'm obviously not doing well, at all, but at the same time I don't want to get stuck again even if I'm losing my sanity.\n\nAny kind of advice is welcome. Just don't be too rough on me, I've had a lifetime of that, and I'm already ashamed of admitting to all of this. I'm my own worst enemy.\n\nIf you're a fellow artist, please tell me about your personal experiences. I know some people are still able to be creative while on meds, while for others it's impossible.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I can't say I blame her... I'm a pretty shameful excuse for a human being.\n\nI just don't really know where to go from here. It's not like our relationship was perfect; we stopped sharing interests, I felt weird trying to fit into her friend group, we both work full time so there hasn't been a lot of intimacy lately. I can totally understand why she would want to move on. And yet, I don't really understand at all....\n\nI've never been a perfect partner; I don't make a 6 figure salary, I don't have a great career, I'm not the best at displays of affection, I could go on and on about how shitty I an as a Boyfriend, but I can honestly say I tried hard to do things to make her happy. It wasn't a sacrifice moving away from my family so she could be closer to her's because I wanted her to be happy. I cooked her favorite meals, bought things I couldn't afford just for her, I would clean and do laundry and take the dog for walks and countless other things because I thought that it was all just a \"labour of love\" . \n\nSo, anyway, after the sudden earth shattering news from her that our relationship is dead, she proceeded to tell me how great of a guy I am, and how we'll still be friends, and how we'll \"share the dog\". As if any of those things will make up for how miserable I am from finding out the one person I chose to be in my life, doesn't want to be that person  anymore. \n\nWe were together for 13 years.... I don't have any friends to speak of because I didn't really see any friendships or relationships mattering as much as ours did. I don't feel like I'm able to come back from this. I really feel like I have no other choice.\n\nMAiD (Medical Assistance in Dying) becomes applicable for people who are solely suffering from a mental illness, starting on the 17th of March in my country. I have sought out other forms of mental health help in the past; nothing has worked. I am ashamed of myself for being as shitty and worthless as I am. I will be applying for MAiD, and quite honestly, when they inevitably say that I don't \"qualify\" or that \" there's other paths to try\", I'm going to straight up tell them that it's either they give me the agency over my life that I've always lacked, or I will take matters into my own hands and it will be a lot messier for everyone.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk\n\nI wish I was fucking dead\n\nSomebody please come blow my fucking brains out.\n\n","Score":3,"Total_comments":0}

In college I worked to be a nurse, and as I was starting to apply for schools, I was kicked out for being gay. No money saved up as I had been working to help afford school, so was forced to give up temporarily. Started working at BestBuy, used there EE college stuff and redid all of my prerequisite classes to apply again as they expire after x years. The semester before I go to apply they added another prerequisite, and due to my odd gap my previous credits would expire a semester early, they wouldn't make exceptions. So I continued at BB and got a degree in Healthcare Administration. Well, now all the positions outside of HR require both the LVN and my degree. I've found nothing that could even support me after years. I worked for the TX gov and was paid garbage, 37k for my skills.

I do recommend giving it a try.\n\nDo you want big friend groups?  I don't think you should compare your social prowess to your peers, especially because your social goals may be different.  It's you're more into having smaller close-knit friend groups, I think that's more what you should aim for.  Some people are more extroverted and would rather the larger groups.  Also, I feel like now that you're out of the high school\/college age, there's kind of a reset.  Adult friendships are different than when you're young, so I think even if you feel behind, you can easily catch up to where you want to be.

All my life I have felt like an imposter and that I am stupid, probably largely because of the abuse I received from her. The only thing I was ever \u201cgood\u201d at in school, or was just more interested in, was art, I really was average and below average in other subjects so I decided to pursue an undergrad degree and a masters degree in fine art with the hope of maybe doing a fine art phd in the future. \n\nI\u2019ve always known that something was wrong with me or not entiretly \u201cnormal\u201d\u2026 always denying this, desperately trying to assimilate and be like everyone else. But I do think I have ADHD or something like that, I haven\u2019t been tested due to losing faith in doctors, but there are so many signs that suggest I do have it that I have always tried to hide or ignore.\n\nI feel like I peaked in art school, having deadlines and being around like-minded people was good for me and I always did well, getting A\u2019s every year. I\u2019m sad it only lasted 4\/5 years. I\u2019ve always struggled with eating, I always wanted a second portion of food when I was younger, but when I started working and having my own money I would spend it on food all the time. I am also in a long term relationship with my high school sweetheart, we live together currently. Gained more weight and started doing mdma to lose it in 2017, I was eating less and moving more and lost 3 stone in a year. Then fast forward to 2020 and the pandemic happens, suddenly we couldn\u2019t go outside for long periods of time and I just went back on all the good habits I had built up over the years, started eating like shit again and being anxious to even go outside at all. Since the pandemic I have never been the same, I went back on my anti depressants, quit my shitty customer service job and pretty much have hibernated since. My boyfriend has alway been supportive of me but I can\u2019t help but feel guilty for being the way I am. He also struggles with anxiety and depression but he always manages to crack on and work despite feeling shit, I can\u2019t do that and I wish I could. I struggle with routine now and can\u2019t seem to get into a habit of doing anything, if I don\u2019t have plans to go out and see any of my friends I won\u2019t shower or brush my teeth and I won\u2019t brush my hair, I\u2019ll only do it when my teeth start to feel gross and my hair is a ball of knots and pits start to really smell. I actually started getting slight tooth ache last month so I\u2019ve started brushing and flossing every night which seems to of taken care of the pain for now, the habit won\u2019t last long though. My libido is non existent too which obviously affects my relationship, I constantly think how he\u2019d be better off without me. I just feel like a shell of a person and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore, I have visions of killing my self every day constantly. I write up notes to individual friends and family for if I do decide to do it\u2026. \n\nI just feel like nothing is going well for me anymore and I\u2019m surrounded by people who also feel depressed. My sister is depressed and going through some health conditions, my dad is depressed and doesn\u2019t eat enough, he also was made redundant during the pandemic for a job he loved and can\u2019t get a job that pays like that job now so he can\u2019t afford basic necessities. My mum is still an alcoholic with a new husband, I just feel like I\u2019m from a family of failures with no one to turn to, which is why I thought going to uni and getting a degree in something I loved would give me something to pursue in this horrible dull world.\n\n My dad is my rock and I love him but he wastes away over red wine and online slots, also now can\u2019t leave the house due to his depression and anxiety. I too now have become an alcoholic since the pandemic started and I drink nearly every evening usually about 1 or 2 bottles of wine. I just don\u2019t have anything to look forward to and nothing to live for and I am excited to get drunk and listen to music to do anything that takes me away from being in bed all day doom scrolling. \n\nThe only reason I am here is because I keep picturing the faces of the people I care about reacting to the news that I decided to take my life. \n\nI know I need help, I want help but I am also scared to ask for it as I\u2019ll be put on a long waiting list (I\u2019m in the uk), and can\u2019t afford private care.

I barely progressed in my studies, I have not become any better at playing guitar or piano, I haven't changed my job, I have not matured mentally, I have completely stagnated as a person, my life is going literally nowhere.\n\nThe main problem I have with this is that I wasted so many years of my life. Even though I'm glad I finally see the bigger picture in what is causing my depression and I've set the goal to \"fix myself\" by the end of 2024 (or earlier preferably), I hate how I wasted so many chances at a better life.\nI had many chances at romantic relationships I dearly wanted, but couldn't get myself to take. I had many chances at succeeding in my studies. I had job opportunities I definitely should've taken. I had a bunch of friends who I all just had to let down. And what I regret mostly, I found true love, something really special, and I had to ruin it and hurt us both.\nMy depression caused an amount of self-sabotage to the point I just can't understand how I let it win the mental battle every damn time.\n\nI can't take the pain of everything I lost anymore. Looking back I can hardly believe how fortunate I've been for all the opportunities, combined with a deep self-hatred for ALWAYS doing the wrong thing.\n\nIt's time to get the ball rolling. But it'll always be in the back of my mind how much I wish I never got depressed from when I was 16, so I could've lived and enjoyed those years for how great they actually could have been.\n\n\nAt 23, I simultaneously feel very old because of my age and very young because i'm still at the same mental stage I was when I was 16.\nI still have dreams I wish to fulfil one day, but I'm afraid my time has passed.\nDo you think that 23 is too old to fulfil dreams you formed when you were 16-18?","Score":1,"Total_comments":1}

I had to stop taking it due to some physical health problems. Essentially, I live on the 4th floor of an apartment complex and have to take the stairs because the elevator gets stuck often. Wellbutrin was making me dizzy, nauseous, and I was experiencing vertigo pretty badly, especially while physically exerting myself (like going up and down 4 flights of stairs twice a day). I have a full time job that I maintain despite my depression. I'm going to school for communication technology and doing well. I\u2019ve been making silly websites since I was like 13 and I have always loved it until recently. My health insurance got cut because I make $1000\/year more than the cut off limit for state insurance in my state, and since I was a temp at my current workplace (just got my offer letter a few weeks ago to get hired on fully), I wasn\u2019t able to sign up for health insurance in time. I now basically just have to wait until I get hired on, my hire date has been pushed back because my county is experiencing a backlog of background checks and they can\u2019t push anything through until the background check comes back (there\u2019s nothing on it). So for the time being I am basically trapped in a non-medicated state with diagnosed major depression disorder, anxiety, and intrusive thoughts. \r  \nI\u2019m writing this because I feel like every single aspect of my life is a chore. I have no interest in my hobbies anymore, I have no interest in playing the video games I\u2019ve previously been obsessed with and enjoyed thoroughly, I basically count the hours until I can go back to sleep every day, the TV shows, youtube channels, movies, all media, that I used to enjoy just feel like another thing on my list to complete. I\u2019ve crocheted since I was very young and even that feels tedious and overwhelming. I feel like there\u2019s nothing that can hold my interest for longer than a few hours. I\u2019ve tried basically everything I can think of from puzzles to actual chores. I know these are all symptoms of my mental illness and I'm frustrated about it, but I don't even have the energy to be truly angry about the unfairness of it all anymore.\r  \nI\u2019ve started taking B12 and D3 vitamins today, no difference in my mood yet (obviously), but I\u2019m hopeful, as hopeful as someone in my condition can be. I have a therapist that I meet with once a week and she\u2019s been extremely helpful with coping skills, but this isn\u2019t something my coping techniques have been able to touch. I\u2019m looking for advice, or even words of encouragement, to help me get through this depression. I only have a few more weeks before I can get on medication again and hopefully start feeling more like myself, but every day feels like a week. I need to know that I won\u2019t always feel like this. Not having interest in the things I love, like painting, making graphics, reading, crocheting, even playing my stupid video games, is killing me inside. I can feel myself deteriorating mentally because even in my darkest times I\u2019ve at least been able to fantasize or imagine little scenarios that have always been able to get me unstuck, but I can\u2019t even do that. Even creating little stories in my head feels like a chore, and I\u2019ve never been this low before. My connections with other people are faltering as well. My friends have sort of fallen away because I lose track of time so easily and forget to respond or feel like my problems are just going to make them feel burdened. I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about this, and even if I did I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d want to. If anyone has experienced this or has something they can tell me that will help me not lose hope in the next few weeks, I need it badly. \r  \n","Score":1,"Total_comments":4}

I wonder if coming off wellbutrin in particular would make you feel this way, as it mostly works on your dopamine, and your symptoms sound dopamine related.  This might give you some hope, knowing that this isn't even necessarily how life is without meds, it may be particularly worse and temporary because your brain is readjusting how it handles dopamine specifically.\n\nWhat about something that you might get fulfillment from, but not necessarily have fun doing.  Like volunteering, altruism, gardening, music, get out into nature, etc.?  Maybe try things like that, that aren't as tied to dopamine, but are tied to overall happiness.  Or, if you have energy for it, maybe use this time to make some healthy changes that will make your overall life better, but aren't necessarily fun, like exercise, or make your living quarters have more positive energy (can't believe I just said that), with candles and ambient sounds or whatever brings you comfort.\n\nI hope that you feel better soon.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

When everything fell apart I wanted this.  It\u2019s like something just clicked in me.  And In some ways I still do still want this.  I bought a revolver as soon as I was old enough to.  I played the shell game, 3 cups, cup1-1bullet, cup2-2bullets, and cup3-3bullets mixed the cups around and chose at random- the cups were shot glasses (got the idea from a movie) so after I was royally fuc%#d I got a little more.  The cold metal in my mouth as I down another shot.  What do they say?  Hashtag \u2018Core Memory Unlocked\u2019 I was never big into drinking.  I\u2019m still not to this day, but it made this easier during this week so what the hell.  Then I used that many bullets to play \u2018Russian-Roulette\u2019 1time a day and after the seventh day I stopped, I bought one of the more basic semi arms out the store.  Was sick of the \u2018should\u2019 or \u2018could\u2019 be not happening- Went to try for what I thought would be last time, and the first success because this was not a revolver, straight forward slide action.  I can still clearly remember the dim lighting from the street lamp outside piercing through my blinds, I can still hear James Blunt\u2019s \u2018Goodbye My Lover\u2019 playing clear as day when I think back to it.  When I cambered it echoed in my head, but when I squeezed it something just clicked in me, in my head, but before it clicked IN me it clicked AT me.  The gunsmith up the road told me the firing pin \u201clooked like it\u2019d been shot 50,000 times!\u201d But it had never been shot.  I purchased it brand new still in the box and rushed home to finally, for the first time EVER, get my monies worth in something!  I still keep the round, it has a very, very small indentation on it, it almost looks like a simple scratch.  I felt like the most unlucky man alive.  I\u2019ve never told someone I know personally this, only shared on forums with \u2018strangers\u2019 so to speak, and they say I\u2019m \u201cthe luckiest person alive\u201d so it all depends on how you look at it- My wants to make an exit?  Still there;  Constantly, they\u2019re still there.  I\u2019ve tried finding other methods like Physician-assisted sui%#de, Rube Goldberg inspired machinery, simple but sure methods that I will not list, just something- ANYTHING that would limit failure to effectively none.  Because something just clicked in me- you see I\u2019m not scared to die, I\u2019m scared of trying and failing just to end up severely damaged in the head where I\u2019m stuck in a chair in some hospital home staring out a window unable to eat, talk, or think anymore; to the point that I no longer have the mental capacity to even remotely think of finishing the job I wanted to complete so badly.  Living out my days being even more of a burden than I feel I am now.  I\u2019ve since distanced myself from literally everyone so as not to have any relationships towards people, so as to not have any big impact for when I can work up the nerve to finish and implement my exit strategy.  Not that there was anyone who\u2019d care that much anyone.  The women I was supposed to spend my life with.. we\u2019d been together since high school.  I mean years and years (I\u2019m not that old but a lot of years) she just went out one night and came back with someone else\u2019s seed planted in her.  And around that time my so called \u2018family\u2019 was the main antagonist literally telling me to end it, to end me.  \u201cTime heals all wounds\u201d is a lie.  I\u2019m now marching up on 1000 days since my downfall.  There\u2019s more loss to the story but my goal is never to have people think \u201che\u2019s got it bad\u201d so it\u2019s pointless to add, I think you see the point- I was down and gloom.  I keep wanting to go out by my own hand.  But that terror of failing haunts me.  And so I prayed for the strength to get over that terror; I prayed to not wake up in the morning, I prayed to be removed.  I still have that terror, and I too, obviously, am still here.  Yet recently(not too recently) a young to middle aged women in a white coat came into the little patient room where I was waiting.  With her deepened look she took a deep breath and said a lot of words, to which after the first 10 words the rest sort of drowned out.  When I came too she was wrapping up her speech.  Her closing remarks were offers to get me on a list and give me medications to feel more comfortable\u2026. These 10 words were \u201cIt\u2019s not good news, it shows stage four renal failure\u201d. Then blah blah blah blah blah then asking if I\u2019m still there and saying \u201cit\u2019s a lot to process\u201d and we can discuss what comes next more in depth the following the day.  I never returned.  I picked up my \u2018medication\u2019 and have basically been high ever since.  High enough to function but not to the point that I\u2019m enjoying anything lol\u2026 Then, Something just clicked in me\u2026 \u201cMy out has come!\u201d  The following days I pieced together a few things the doctor told me- hindsight is NOT 20-20 lol but there was mention of options and recently there\u2019s been some days where I\u2019ve been thinking if I should explore those options\u2026 I don\u2019t even know if those options are still available.  Hell, yesterday I even called the doctors office- I hung up as soon as they answered tho.  Something I so desperately wanted now has me wondering from time to time.  Yet, it\u2019s too late to wonder.  I\u2019m convinced that I deserve this, and all the pain that comes with it.  But what really \u2018blows my mind\u2019 (shitty pun) is that I never felt sick.  Not until the 8th day when I went and got that basic arm.  But then something just clicked in me\u2026.. and Here I Am, for now, not knowing what to do next, if there is anything to do, or even if I should try to do anything at all?

How are people able to write such long, informative and complex posts if they are depressed..I have often seeing people asking for help on forums describing their condition very articulately and also sharing their knowledge .when I am really  depressed, I can't even pick my phone and write anything, not enough dopamine which motivates me to do anything...even if I try i won't be able to articulate my facts and more so, fingers will start shaking since anxiety comes hand in hand with severe  depression  .so how are all these people able to do it..is it possible that they are not actually depressed but just sad and they think that they are depreesed....?..or is it that they are just focussing on their post and might not be able to comprehend others post and that's why they are able to write..?..(which is what i think if they are severely depressed)..\n\nCan anyone  plz reply to these pointwise..?...also, would be highly  grateful if replies are honest and objective in nature...also have you guys ever wondered on similar points..?","Score":2,"Total_comments":2}

Proof in person! It took me a few years to stop social anxiety from interfering with my life, and at times, it still rears its ugly head, but I\u2019m grateful I\u2019m still here.

That\u2019s a lot to go through. \n\nI quit medication because I genuinely got so depressed I wanted to die. Thankfully, I talked to my doctor about it, and we found out it was just the wrong kind of medication. I was being medicated for depression, but the ones that targeted anxiety more worked better. \n\nIn terms of sleep, talk to your doctor about a combination of two meds. I take hydroxyzine and trazodone at bedtime. Hydroxyzine helps me shut that nighttime anxiety up and allows me to relax enough to go to sleep. Trazodone keeps me asleep because I will literally have panic attacks while I\u2019m sleeping that will wake me up. Those two medications have been a godsend. \n\nI know you had a shitty experience with your first medication, and that is really hard to get over. Not all medications are going to be like that.

For as long as i can remember, I could smile only if someone else was smiling. I would put my life aside or pause anything i\u2019m doing with no second thought in order to help somebody else. Young me thought nothing of it, as if i\u2019m living like everyone else. As my life went by, I started to understand what\u2019s going on and I nearly killed myself because of it.\n\nI was a happy child, school was so fun! I loved my parents dearly and they loved me back. My mum, the only person who\u2019s hugs i loved the most, who\u2019s hands were the most safe place in the world for me, would change and never be the same again. \n\nOur life changed when we had to move countries. My mum got a stressful job, my dad, a marine engineer, was barely home. He had 4 month sea trips with 3 months in between, when he could return and stay home. My older sister stayed back in the country we left, studying at uni. So for the majority of the time it was me and my mum home. The two of us. \n\nI was 11 when she became the person I feared the most. Everyday day at work she took out on me when she came home. I always came home before her and did everything in my power to leave the house spotless to not make her shout at me because I knew If I didn\u2019t please her, it\u2019s over. And every time she yelled, I took it all in, i kept quiet and never talked back. In fact, I felt guilty. I hated myself for not being able to make her happy. \nShe would throw tantrums, slam her bedroom door and I was the one to keep calm, check on her and ask her if she was okay. Naturally, I never spoke of my emotions because I didn\u2019t want her to be upset. In my young mind, I was the bad person. I began to believe I didn\u2019t deserve anything nice and If I wanted something, i would feel guilty. I felt like society was against me, everyone hated me, I began to dread every time I had to leave my house and go outside\u2026\n\nThis kept up until I was 16, just when I was old enough to not feel those emotions anymore. I was now an empty shell of the happy child I once was. My mother\u2019s arms were unapproachable and my house was a place i didn\u2019t want to return to at the end of the day. I hated her. I was only comfortable when I was home alone. Alone. Eventually stress took a toll on my body and I started loosing hair, weight, muscle.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost three years since my suicide attempt. Life got even harder, I feel like I\u2019ve aged 20 years as my body is weak and I never have enough energy. But I\u2019m medicated, and depression is now mostly under control.\n\nMy mother changed. The news of me being long-term mentally ill definitely were a wake up call for her. It\u2019s been three long years of me opening up to her again. She fixed her behaviour for me and eventually I was ready to forgive. I felt love again. \n\nRight now, uni is just around the corner for me and I have to leave home. Couple of years ago I would have been thrilled but as of today I feel very heavy hearted. After all these years I finally have a mother again! I feel loved again\u2026I don\u2019t want to leave her home alone when dad is away at sea. Whenever I imagine my mum sitting in an empty house alone in front of the tv, it makes me tear up. I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026\n\nThe uni I want to go to is on the other side of the country. How should I be? Do I push through and leave or should I stay in my town and study something else?\n\nSorry for the long post. If you got all the way here, I appreciate you very much for reading.

It\u2019s a 2019 WRX and I\u2019m a huge rally racing nerd but I\u2019ve never driven manual before. \n\nIt\u2019s been a month since I bought it and am finally over the fear being anxious driving anywhere. I\u2019ve struggled with depression and have taken great strides from where I was in the past. I have a proper job now. I\u2019m learning how to be strong by myself and live by myself. I\u2019m working hard on just being a better person than I was yesterday but deep down I\u2019m so tired. I\u2019ve been tired for years. \n\nThe new job requires a lot of me and I\u2019ll just say I sell high end cars. I\u2019m reaching the point where I don\u2019t have much left in me to continue taking care of myself and being proactive. Day by day I feel more tired and more exhausted. Just drained. I\u2019m losing enjoyment in things that brought me joy before because I have no energy for them. Every now and then I think about killing myself. Some days more than others. I\u2019ve only once ever had a plan but that was a couple years ago and never had a day picked out. If anything I feel like I would kill myself spontaneously. \n\nI\u2019m still exhausted and alone. I\u2019m 23 years old and don\u2019t have many friends outside of work except from my home state which means they are 1+ hour away and with my work schedule now, I never see them. I come home from work and sit in my room alone. I live with my parents and realized when I was younger how much of a stress I put on my parents because of my bad mental health. Now I don\u2019t tell them much about how I\u2019m feeling but try to stay stoic. \n\nMy exhaustion has gotten so bad that the thoughts of ending it are increasing. The one thing I promised myself was that I won\u2019t end it until I master my car. I don\u2019t know exactly why I made that promise to myself. I guess it\u2019s because if I do it before I pay off the car my parents will take on that debt and lose their son. Mastering manual cars is something that takes time. So it\u2019s a long road ahead. Another thing I thought of was that the journey that this will provide me may actually bring some hope in my life. And I get a small little bit of joy that the dream of my car saving my life will be there. But in the end it\u2019s just a fantasy. That my car will save me from misery. \n\nIn a sense it may be an ultimatum, every time I get the thought of just committing myself to death I remember this promise. And that the promise doesn\u2019t have a concrete goal because what exactly is \u201cmastering a manual car\u201d? \n\nIt could be an infinite means with no end goal. And I wonder if what I promised is exactly positive or morbid? I don\u2019t know why I came to Reddit to express this but I think it\u2019s just because I have no outlet and hold thoughts in.\n\n Can anyone help me understand if a promise like this is a step in the right direction or just a morbid insight? \n\nHow do I help myself from constant exhaustion? I want to be positive and proactive but can\u2019t find the energy and feel as though I\u2019m at the end. And the only thing keeping me going is learning how to drive a car but in turn creating a shell of a human being.\n","Score":21,"Total_comments":15}

Cars break down, are expensive, rust, risk collisions, maintenance. You can find enjoyment in them but to put your life hopes and dreams into it will leave you feeling empty.. At your age of 23 what I would recommend to you is begin to track your finances better. Budget your money and start saving.. try to work your way up in your career and see if you can get to a higher level.

I don't see myself as particularly attractive, so mustering up the courage to hit the clubs was a big deal. Recently I feel this pain in my chest when the depression hits but I just decided to ignore it that night.

With each passing moment, the pain inside me grew stronger. Eventually, I couldn't bear it anymore, and I retreated into my own thoughts, overwhelmed by feelings of loneliness and inadequacy.

Then my mental health took a severe downward turn and I am still struggling to pull it back into place. I want to go to veterinary school, but I have c's in all of my chemistry, organic chemistry and biochemistry courses. Some b's in my math and physics and A's in the rest including biology. I applied to vet school this past cycle and got turned down from all of my choices. I can't redo my classes since they are undergraduate and I will be graduating with my bachelors this may and need that time to make my application shine in other respects like hours with a vet shadowing. And to be honest I would have turned me down that first cycle to - my application absolutely sucked. I had below average essays and gpa (right now I have a 3.3 overall and 3.0 science - this should be better after this semester as I have kept A's in all of my courses so far), no current experience, and virtually no clinical experience.\n\nIt is just so hard to think of what I could have should have done to make my current position better. I am angry with myself that I didn't do better in my core classes. I'm angry that I didn't think to get help earlier. I'm angry that I didn't pull myself up and get some vet experience. I'm so angry with myself and how my sadness has the potential to ruin my chances of getting into medical school. How do I explain to teachers and professors and vets that I didn't get the experience I needed because it took all of my energy to just  get out of bed let alone come to class. How do you explain that to people who tell you that you are below average in basically everything that you need to get into vet school and that I should have tried harder? Studied harder? gotten help? talked to professors? How the fuck do you explain that I was just trying to stay alive and on this earth for another day and got to the point were I truly didn't care what happened to me anymore?\n\nBut yet I'm am still here, I came out the other side of my sister running away, my grandmas hording house being gone through by my mother and myself for 4 months and then sold with her being put into a home, I came out the other side with my other grandma and grandpa passing within days of each other. I came out the other side when my parents fought like cats and dogs. I came out the other side. And I'm proud that I did, but why in the hell did all of this have to leave such a mark. A mark that has the potential to change the entire coarse of my life.\n\nI still struggle daily with dark thoughts, depression and anxiety. I'm trying to turn my life around and make the best of what has happened and take control of my life again. I have vet shadowing set up with two local veterinarians, I'm volunteering at my local humane society, and my mentor and I are talking about the possibility of me either double majoring with a minor or just moving on with a masters while I'm in this in-between stage for vet school (basically trying to make my academic resume look better for my second application cycle), my parents and I communicate better and I am on some meds.\n\nBut truly... how do you explain without making it sound you want pity - that my academic career got severely affected by poor mental health?","Score":3,"Total_comments":0}

Just obsessed over morbid things online instead, afterlife videos etc. \n\nI paced around the house a lot, didn\u2019t eat well, didn\u2019t exercise, refused the help offered to me from professionals, i.e. therapy. I didn\u2019t contact friends often, didn\u2019t see anyone in person aside from family for that entire period of time. \n\nI\u2019m concerned now that, because of these destructive behaviours, I\u2019ve ruined my life completely? I was in such a positive groove before and I had everything under control. But now it feels like my concentration is so bad, my knowledge has evaporated, social skills are awful, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve been in solitary confinement and I\u2019m relearning what life is again. Very unsettling at this age, 27, when I should be in the prime of my life and levelling up to success. \n\nHad a fantastic career going and other areas were near perfect too, physique, health in general, relationship, my perception of myself was great, I had values built up whereby I commanded respect and I was in general a very likeable, and driven, confident human being. I became the man I wanted to my whole life.\n\nIt really feels like I won\u2019t be able to get that back, because I can\u2019t help feeling like I\u2019ve gone too far with this depression.

For context, it's considered one of the best cities to live in worldwide. I've got a good job, great apartment, close friends, family nearby, and a borderline debilitating urge to leave it all behind and just move to another country. I feel absolutely depressed here, but I'm scared of making the wrong decision. \n\nThe thing is, despite how great this city is, I feel like I have too much trauma tied to it. As good as my life seems seems on paper, I've been through a lot here, including: growing up with an alcoholic parent, having a close friend die suddenly (roommates at the time), enduring an emotionally traumatizing relationship (5+yrs), and being assaulted (S.A.). I have a lot of trauma from men throughout my entire life, unfortunately.\n\nI have been in therapy for a decade, was doing ok, but then my sweet angel dog passed away. He was basically holding me together all these years\u2014my absolute best friend. It's been over a year and I sob almost every day after I come home. My therapist says that as long as I'm functioning (eating, going to work, doing life tasks) then it's okay; I'm just grieving. But I am practically crawling out of my skin to get out of here and leave everything behind. The only time I am happy is when I'm out of the country (I travel for a month each summer) and then I come back and am beyond depressed again. \n\nIf I leave, I'll probably never be able to come back realistically. My job and apartment are rare gems in this city, so it's a massive risk. But I can't keep going like this; something's gotta change. ","Score":4,"Total_comments":4}

Imagination creates reality. The issue is that we have a ton of automatic thought patterns and behaviors which we constantly focus our attention on, so we mostly get more of the same in our lives. So we're mostly stuck in a pattern that started from birth unless we focus our imagination towards the realization of our goals which pushes us into a new reality.\n\nThe book \"The Law and The Promise\" goes over this concept more.

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"1b448vj","Title":"I found a knife under my wife's pillow yesterday","Author":"Throw-me-away1919","Timestamp":1709324103000,"Text":"Hi, this will be a long text.\n\nContext:My wife suffers from depression for about 2 years now. Or at least that's when she has been diagnosed, started getting meds and since then she is in therapy. We both think she has been depressed for some time before that.\n\nDuring this period there were ups and downs, but last \\~6 months were super hard for me. I try to be as supportive as it gets, but I started feeling like a punching bag. My wife is functional - she actually runs her own small company and still maintains her social life to some extent. All energy she has left in her she spends on keeping up the facade of a normal life. Unfortunately, I feel like I am in the other side of the spectrum - our relationship is going to shits. Usually after spending all the energy on professional and social life she comes home and either falls asleep for 12-14 hours or becomes super irritable. Lately she says she has been doing better, but I don't see the reflection of it in our life - actually the opposite. Lately we started going to the therapy together (per my request), but it didn't bring no positive results (we are high and positive after the therapy, but then eveything goes back to normal almost immediately)\n\nWhen she was diagnosed I decided to go to therapy myself to both make sure I give her appropriate support, but at the same time to have a place for focusing on my own emotions with regard to her depression. While for first 1,5 years I could manage daily life with her depression, for the past 6 months I have been gradually feeling worse myself. I can't focus at work (and I am our main source of income, so I can't loose focus), I started getting physical symptoms (bruxism) and most of all, I started having suicidal thoughts myslef. At first I was shrugging them off, but this week it was too much and I took them to my therapist. While before that she was advising to take time and digest emotions when I was upset with our relationship, this time she said I have to take some action - whether that be a breakup, separation or some other radical change in our lives. During the course of multiple weeks of therapy we confirmed our relationship was the source of my current state.\n\nNow I tie it back to the title.\n\nYesterday I decided to let her know how I feel. I told her that I am feeling really really bad (without disclosing my suicidal thoughts though) and I really really need a change in our life. Let her know that I am serious. As always we had a discussion, exchanged how we feel, she said she feels similarily and after some time she says she does not have energy to talk no longer. She took a bath and went to our bedroom.\n\nAfter around 30 mins, she messages me saying \"can you give me a hug?\". I heard her crying quitely for the past 30 mins (I normally would go and try to comfort her, but she asked some time ago not to do it unless she asks for it), so I go and give her a hug. We proceed to talk for another half an hour, after which I feel something hard under the pillow and realize it's a handle of our kitchen knife.\n\nObviously I am distressed at this point, I knew she sometime has suicidal thoughts but it was never this real. I keep my composure and proceed to spend next 2 hours talking with her about it until she actually feels good, is happy we had this conversation and we actually manage to turn the whole situation into something constructive and helpful for her. We fall asleep together. During the conversation she says she sometimes takes the knife to feel better but would never do anything to herself and I should not be worried. She says she has been doing this for a long time already. It turns out she never mentioned it to her therapist, so I convince her she needs to do it for things to get better.  \n\n\nToday she seemed to be happy, she was energetic and everything goes well, she goes to work, I go to work, it seems we pulled her out from this depressive state. All is well again.  \n\n\nBut I am not - I know that we fought off yesterday's evening crisis but not the long-term crisis. In a day or two again everything will fall apart.  \n\n\nI need support in two things:\n\n\\- Knife in bed - what do I do now? She is in therapy, she takes meds, she visits psychiatrist, I do not know what else could be done now? \n\n\\-Myself - I feel I am trapped. Any mention of my mental wellbeing leads to an argument, and arguments lead to her falling back into depression. Now on top of that I constantly will think about the fact she might have a knife with her anytime my boundaries are being crossed. I am her main support, we have been together since high school, for the past 10 years we grew up together. She does not have anyone who she could really lean back on.  \nOn the other hand I do not know how much do I still have in me to be there for her while I myself am falling deeper and deeper into a hole\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust FYI I am not from the US so please share what approach should I do rather than sharing specific organisations\/links, thanks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nILY\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","Score":16,"Total_comments":3}

I've for the longest time always thought it was a hoax and how could anyone feel that way? Just slap yourself out of it. But I think I have slowly been falling into it for the past few months and now I'm in it. Before the beginning of last year I was happy. I lived in the city, i had a nice job, a loving wife, happy kids. But I had a buisness opportunity come up and we packed up and moved back where I'm from which is a rural area. I ended up getting screwed out of the property I was suppose to be renting. Ended up not being able to find another location so we decided I would be the stay at home parent and my wife would go back to work. We than also decided it would be good for her to continue school. So she is a full time employee and full time student. I have been watching my kids (5Y M) (2Y G) (7.5MTH G) for the past year. In the beginning it was great but as time went on I started losing myself as a person. My wife and I both noticed I started lashing out at small things. I went from someone who's worked since I can remember to someone who stays home all day on the couch listening to baby talk all day. My parents AND my wifes parents decided to get divorced last year. My friends don't talk to me anymore, I don't ever leave the house, I'm fine with my wife providing but I want to contribute as well. The jobs in this area don't pay anywhere near enough for me to go back to work and to get a baby sitter. I'm unsure how to handle this depression stuff. Also I'm not suicidal but I don't see the point in living if that makes any sense(it feels like my own brain or thoughts tell me sometimes whats the point in living a life like this when i dont want to think like that). I want to be here for my kids and wife but I also feel empty as a person and a man. I'm awkward in social settings when I use to be great at talking to people. My wife tries to help where she can but she quite honestly isn't the type of person who could help someone through depression. My mom told me to either get help or get over it. It's not that I don't want to make changes it just our situation and financially where we are this is just how it has to be for now.  I guess I posting to both find people who can relate, get some things off my chest and maybe find some ways to navigate this beast.","Score":2,"Total_comments":2}

What you are describing in terms of your career and day-to-day sounds very stressful. I think it is important to note right away that you are absolutely contributing by being the primary caretaker of your three children, which I imagine is an exhausting task. I also think it is important to note that it makes perfect sense that having three young, pre-school age children would cause a lot of stress, especially when coupled with losing some of the meaning in your life that you found through your career. While it is in the future, your children will get older and will start to attend school over time and hopefully some of the more acute challenges of actively caring for 3 children 24\/7 will abate some.\n\nI'm sure it must feel very lonely to feel like your wife can't help you through your depression and that your mother is not particularly supportive. That feeling of emptiness is not fun and can reinforce itself. In my experience, the biggest thing that you can do is to try to put yourself in positions where you can have more happiness. \n\n\nYou've described feeling lonely a lot, given that you stay with the kids all day. This is a common problem for many stay at home parents, and is a frequent topic of discussion. I'm there are groups and articles that could help you think of solutions to try to deal with that. Naively, maybe seeking out other parents through meetups, classes or even at the park could be an idea? Getting out of the house, and having some interaction with other adults (even if it is in the context of your children) has been helpful for some people I know.\n\n\n\nLastly, given your low mood, you should make sure to give yourself grace. When you feel bad, it is normal to not want to talk to people, even though that might be one of the reasons why you feel bad in the first place. Forgive yourself and recognize that it is ok to be imperfect and that you should just try when you can. Focusing on recent failures distracts you from the now and often only makes you feel worse. \n\n\nLastly, if you have insurance that covers it, you may want to consider talking to a psychologist and\/or seeking out a psychiatrist for antidepressants. For some people I know they have been helpful in allowing them to stabilize their mood enough for them to get their life more in order. \n\n\nIt is not weird for you to feel bad or \"depressed\" because of the difficult things that have occurred in your life over the last year. People can be depressed for no reason and can also be depressed for very good ones. Changing the material conditions of your life (more connections with others, getting a job or some kind of activity even if it doesn't make much more than needed to pay the baby sitter) can be a fix for the latter (at least that's my experience).","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

Nobody has been able to understand, because I think I'm not a good person. I just want people to help me like I try to help them.","Score":2,"Total_comments":1}

I don\u2019t want to eat, I just want to stay in bed all day and cry. \n\nI tried to get out and walk around and listen to music and get myself a pineapple juice which usually helps me be happier but ended up crying outside my apartment building when nothing even happened. I\u2019m just filled with this overwhelming despair over nothing and i feel like the people around me I don\u2019t deserve so I don\u2019t want to be around them anymore but I don\u2019t want to hurt them. I feel guilty because I\u2019m hurting everyone and I\u2019m not doing enough for them but I haven\u2019t even done anything to them.\n\nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve just hit an all time rut with no end in sight.

Depression may ease occasionally, but the unbearable pain returns again and again, gnawing away more and more of what little hope you carry.

I know how hard it can be to navigate and get medication when you don't have insurance. There are people, programs and groups that can help you, but it can often feel confusing and frustrating to navigate these maze like systems. The exact way to get help can vary from state to state, but often calling a state-specific mental or behavioral helpline can be a useful approach. You might want to try googling your state plus \"behavioral helpline\" or similar terms.

My life since middle school has just been mindlessly going through emotions and finding some way to enjoy them or deciding I've had enough and neglecting my school work.

There's no genuine concern for my future when I'm getting F's or excitement for the rewards that straight A's are promised to bring. I just want to die. It's not the typical suicide of overbearing pressure or despair or whatever. I just see the math. I'm not enjoying life, so why bother continuing?

Day after day I struggle to just live my life because of my anxiety always telling me something will go wrong 100% guaranteed or even worse that it already HAS happened and I'm being looked down upon. I really fucking hate this quality about me, and it's one I've been dealing with for YEARS at this point. Hell, I miss the old days when I was little and just a simple kid loving life occasionally being a troublemaker. Nowadays I feel like I need to be perfect, like every little mistake might just kill me. And the worst fucking thing besides the fact that I suffer the same thing daily, is the fact that I have no fucking idea where it came from. I've had a relatively nice life, with a loving mother who's done her best and STILL does her best to keep me alive and healthy, I have a house to live on, I never starve at home, nothing. Yet I suffer from this bullshit everyday and I don't get it, why? I don't have any friends, and the ones who call themselves my friends are people who have inserted themselves into my life, half of them i don't even like but again thanks to my anxiety I pretend. I rarely get physically sick from my anxiety except for stomach discomfort, but still it's more of a mental torture for me. My life feels like a repetition of gaining hope and then losing it, building progress then getting tired and back to square one, and it gotten to the point where I don't feel like living nor dying, I'm just there existing, I just feel eveything and nothing at the same time. I really don't know what to do and all the help I get is \"It'll get better soon\" but honestly even though I know maybe one day it will then I'll realize how I wasted all these years and then get depressed over it, like another cycle that I won't be able to climb out of.

All I wanted to know if there's anything that can help alleviate my symptoms for the day. Pretty much what I do is, well first off take my medicine as soon as I remember to, then just lie down in the dark and avoid any kind of light, even from my phone. Oh and also avoid loud sounds. That helps but not much. I honestly don't mind feeling feverish but the headache really sucks, I hate getting headaches. I tried looking it up but google only comes up with answers about Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome, which honestly I didn't know was a thing. Problem is, this is talking about people willingly stopping or wanting to stop their meds, and the advice is essentially to either talk to your doctor about tapering it off or start taking the meds again. That's not what I want though, I just want to see if there's any way to stop the symptoms for that day, because either way I will continue my medication since it helps a lot. I've tried Tylenol but it doesn't help at all. Does anyone have any advice? Would be much appreciated \ud83d\udc4d.

My fianc\u00e9e and I suspect that she has OCD.  I don't know if I have an anxiety or depression disorder, but I am convinced I do.  I've been prone to panic attacks since 2012 and would often have thoughts that make me really depressed. \n\nI've set a goal about 10 days ago to finally quit smoking weed\/delta8\/10 and nicotine vapes.  I've been smoking weed for 10 years, and vaping for only 2 months almost daily.  I've been on 10mg Laxapro since December 2023.  I usually consume 1-3 beers and 2-4 oz of liquor per week.  \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I had an argument 2 weeks ago, and I've been more depressed than I've ever been ever since then.  I said some things I did not mean, and I completely regret it.  I've told her this, but she still thinks about it, which I understand.  I told her to keep her engagement ring off.  I don't remember what she said that made me say that, I didn't mean it.  That same night, I started walking to the bedroom to grab my gun and shoot myself.  She was able to stop me.  The ammunition had been put away in a locked drawer, and I don't know where the keys are.  Ever since then, parts of our argument has been on repeat inside my head.  \n\nI used to love myself, but now I hate myself, and can't forgive myself.  I love her with all my heart, I really do.  I'm willing to help her with her OCD, anxiety, depression, whatever she may have.  It's the times when things are hard is when I sometimes feel like I can't take it anymore, and she'd be better off with someone else who's able to handle it better than I can.  She sometimes tells me that I'm better off with someone who isn't like her, and that my life would be easier.  I cannot imagine my life without her.  My luck in dating was so shitty before the pandemic when we met, I can't imagine how difficult it must be now.  \n\nI'm fighting these thoughts of self harm and suicide, and I feel like I'm having a mental breakdown inside my head and not showing it.  I had a really messy breakup back in 2018 with another girl that really messed me up.  She threatened to cut herself after I said I didn't want to move in with her after 2 months of dating.  Then her stalker started harassing me and threatening me for a month after I said I wanted to take a break.\n\nI don't think I ever learned how to forgive myself.  I've watched a lot of videos on YouTube from Dr. K (HealthyGamerGG), but I'm still struggling a lot.  I've studied Stoicism and have a few self-help books, but I'm still like this.  Neither my fianc\u00e9e or I are willing to do couples therapy because that didn't help the first time.  We don't argue all the time.  In fact, things have been going very well since a few weeks prior to my proposal back in December 2024.  Some bad days here and there as I'm sure most couples have.  \n\nI'm just in a really dark place at the moment.  Between all of this, searching for an IT job for the past year, wedding planning stress, financial stress, it's all getting to me.  I feel like it's getting worse.  Any advice at all is appreciated.

It's a very lonely feeling and I'm so sorry you're going through this. \n\nHave you been able to take medication before? Our brains are so powerful that when even slightly out of balance they can convince us of anything, and it's scary when I slip back into one of my low points even now that I have it under control with meds and even though I can recognize what's happening. \n\nIt takes time to find what works and that can be frustrating in a different way, but it is worth it to get out of the dull monotony. I hope you find something that works for you, friend.\n\nEdit: Also, I've found so much mental peace in not comparing my personal growth to other people. It's hard especially when people share about their lives all the time but everyone is on their own timeline and all that matters is focusing on your own health and wellbeing and if that means small goals like picking a few things up off the floor today and carrying one cup to the kitchen then that can be a huge step to getting out of the rut.","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

I'm so glad you've found that exercise and a lifestyle change has worked for you.\n\nI want to assure you that typically the types of meds they give for depression are not addictive or habit forming. With medication like SSRIs or SNRIs they correct an imbalance in the absorption of certain neurotransmitters (specifically serotonin and norepinephrine) in your brain which neurons use to regulate emotions by sending many small complex signals within your brain. \n\nWhen someone has depression or anxiety it can be because their serotonin or norepinephrine is being absorbed back into the body too quickly so the neurons don't have a chance to use them. By taking SSRIs or SNRIs you can keep those neurotransmitters around longer to help those brain signals function more like they would in a person who does not have anxiety\/depression. \n\nSorry for such a long reply, but I hope this helps to explain how the meds work.

Mom used to work  so pretty much I grew up with grandparents, aunt in laws l, cousins and friends. Specially during teenage years , I had a lot of friends.\n\nAlways had to financially depend on uncles, felt like a parasite. My Mom was always under pressure from the family because she was a divorced, single mom working lady. It\u2019s a South Asian family as I said. Constant mental pressure on my mom which impacted. I saw her crying so much growing up that it took a toll on me.\n\nThings went south before covid when my mom decided to get married after staying single for a long time. I did support the idea tho, because I thought she does need someone to spend the life with and Id have a family finally so I was happy.\nProblem started after the marriage. Suddenly I got 3 fucking step siblings which I didn\u2019t have a mentality match. It was hard to cope. Second, my step dad was an abuser and a lier. He lied to my mom about his past marriages and had more kids. He was verbally and physically abusive towards my mom. I went through these conditions for the 2-3 years, when finally after massive fight mom decided to get outta there. So, now I am fucking back again at my grandparents house. \n\nAt that point, my mental was already fucked, always being financially dependent on my uncles or grandparents, constantly listening to their rants on how I am basically living off them made me feel like a parasite. I didn\u2019t have any motivation, no ambition, no plans. Lost interest in all hobbies and things I like doing. Only thing was I had friends to share my suffering with.\n\nLast year, after I finished my high school. My uncle who lives in Toronto wanted me to move there for studies. Paying for university wasn\u2019t really an option for me despite me wanting to get into one. So I had to enrol in a diploma program in a public college. This way I can work part-time and save up for the semester while studying. (My uncle doesn\u2019t take rent or grocery money from me). First two semesters fee were loans which I have to pay back later on my own.\n\nI wanted to study software engineering. Firstly, the fucking asshole admission agent convinced my uncle  that the program I wanna take ain\u2019t good and pushed some dog shit customer service program which he is probably was affiliated with. I didn\u2019t get the option to choose what I wanted to study. I had to choose something similar so I chose computer engineering because the fucking agent was okay with that.\n\nFinally moved to Toronto, excited for a new start. Was going with a great flow in the beginning. Not for long tho,\nCollege life struck me with the first attack, I had no friends, these colleges mostly have Indian international students, they made their own groups with people only from their respective states back home. I tried my absolute best to befriend people but it just wasn\u2019t working. Adding up, I couldn\u2019t find any part-time job at that time. I started loosing that flow, my motivation went down, I was loosing focus, the depression was coming back. \n\nDepression finally came back when I failed 3 courses in my first semester. I chose computer engineering because of that asshole agent, I wanted to learn programming but now I was also learning Electrical and electronics engineering concepts, which I didn\u2019t understand and had no interest in.\n\n I tried to talk to my uncle about changing my program. He refused. For him the education or certification didn\u2019t matter. He just wants me to somehow get the permanent residency. Basically wanted me to go to one of those stupid career colleges which has no studying, which whould allow me to do more hours of minimum wage jobs and get the PR first.\nOn the other hand I wanted to be career oriented and not waste my early 20\u2019s spending money and time on some useless certificate. Learning a skill which I could use universally is more appealing to me than a Canadian PR with no skills at my mid 20\u2019s.\n\nSecond semester, again tried for  fresh start, but again, I couldn\u2019t find anyone to even help me with studies. Started to not attend classes, became bed lock. Found a weekend physical  labour cash job. That whole semester I just lied in bed, went out so my uncles family thinks  that am going to classes, came back and slept. Again I failed a course and dropped another.\n\nSemester 3, no motivation, studying something that I don\u2019t wanna study, no focus, no drive, can\u2019t remember when is the last time I did things I liked doing. Nothing brings joy to me. I spent my week just doing absolutely nothing. Chronic overeating issues, addicted to smoking and masturbating. Tried therapy around this time, didn\u2019t really help. Can\u2019t like talking to anyone. This point I am just numb, this numbness is just terrifying. Started having suicidal thoughts. Started smoking weed every week. Semester three I failed all 6 courses. End of the semester I started smoking weed everyday and I am still doing it.\n\nNow, It\u2019s my semester break, working 2 jobs trying to save up for fourth semester. 11 courses to retake while my study permit ends on fall.(Family members don\u2019t know about this) Everyone disappointed on me as usual, caught smoking weed so they treat me like a meth addict now, can\u2019t go out unless I have work. Haven\u2019t met or talked to whatever friends I made here for the last 6 months. Don\u2019t even wanna talk to family or friends back home. I am just isolated now, smoking weed actually helps me get shit done because normally I can\u2019t pick myself up to get things done. I am just lost, I don\u2019t see any future for me. My suicidal thoughts are really strong rn. I wanna live for me, live for my mom. Wanna get an actual good life. \n\nPlease guide me, please help me get my shit together. I don\u2019t wanna live wanting to die, waiting for the night so I can just pass out and escape reality, I wanna live a normal life please help me.","Score":1,"Total_comments":1}

Take care of yourself and try to make a habit of making yourself your favorite meal when you wake up, or just overall have something in your everyday routine that you can look forward to for motivation to get out if bed. The other thing I recommend would be joining online communities that peak your interest. I may sound like a weirdo saying this but try any online community like discord or simply just here in reddit. Once you join a good community, maybe you'll find better friends there. It doesn't even have to be online. You could join clubs and organizations outside that maybe help with charity work that can help you see the deeper meaning in life. Spend more time with your mom and overall just bond with her for a while. You two can help each other since you've both been through a lot together. Lastly, stay optimistic. There are loads of other things that can help you. You haven't experienced the best parts of your life, just make sure that you have a drive to get better.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I could help my mom out , my sister with her college tuitions a bit,  but nah, there is no opportunity ,i just feel like not waking up. \n\nI feel old, and with a setback, most of my friends will finish college soon, they are working,  some have relationships and they just seem to generally get to live life , with ups and downs. I get nothing,  not even a chance , i just rot in my room , my dreams feel too far-fetched sometimes,  i just want to give up on them sometimes. What puts me down isn't that i don't have the energy to do things , i have never had this energy,  i always did things on discipline,  still i am not enough to deserve one chance. \n\nI would appreciate any words of encouragement.\n\nSorry for the weird English.

I am a 45 year old male experiencing depression and anxiety at the same time. I am married and have two girls, 9 and 12. I have tried a lot of meds and none are working. I do not know exactly what has brought this on, but I am struggling severely. All I want to do is lay in bed and hide. As soon as I do get up, I am immediately anxious.  I struggle to make decisions and feel like my memory is shot. My social life has all but disappeared. I am seeing a therapist so that I can talk through things, but I am not sure what I am getting out of it as this is my first time seeing one.  My psychiatrist seems to be out of ideas. A little backstory\u2026I started Paxil when I was 25 for GAD and it has kept it at bay until recently. 4 years ago I started feeling pretty depressed, so I decided to switch to Zoloft. Since then, I have been on multiple antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers to try to even myself out. My anxiety was fine until I tried Lexapro. I had bad anxiety on it and it has not let up since. I am now taking 1 mg of Xanax to get through my work days, which I am not sure is very good for the depression, which is getting worse. I am irritable with my kids and pets and I feel like I am one step away from cracking. Either from the anxiety or the depression, but mostly the anxiety. I am terrified of losing my job. I cannot seem to motivate myself to exercise. I feel overwhelmed frequently. My psychiatrist seems to think I should try testosterone treatment even though I am just within the normal range. I am not so sure about this as the studies on it seem to question the efficacy of this and the long-term effects are not really known.  She also believes I should consider TMS which I may be interested in. I guess I am just reaching as I know a lot of people out there are struggling as I am and I am looking for support and any words of encouragement or ideas. I do not know what to do at this point. I feel lost. Thank you for reading and any advice would be helpful.","Score":7,"Total_comments":13}

Now at the lowest I've ever been before. Was there any specific event that caused it? No. Can I blame it on anything tangible and objective? No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR Best way I can describe it is that I feel like I'm a very small, small shell of my past self. Entirely 2 different people. With no apparent reason. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeak Me 1 month ago: Academic excellence, I would say I was pretty engaging, a social butterfly, easygoing, and able to adapt to anyone's personality. It felt like every time I was approached with a new topic I could easily bullshit anything and I was assertive. It felt like I had an array of dialogue options to choose from that all flowed subconsciously and naturally.  My thoughts were like a Michelin restaurant, with so many fine-dining pristine dishes to pick and devour. \n\nThen suddenly I woke up and it felt like I got a reset button pushed, almost like I was reborn and I forgot how to do everything. Checked it medically obviously, but nothing wrong with me. I had everything going on in life, a plethora of friends, supportive family, a secure job path. It's been a month, and I've spoken to so many people about it, tried therapy. It just sucks because I know that in the end it rests with me having to figure it out.  \n\nI can act normally obviously with people, but it's just the nuance and nitty gritty of speaking to people my age, I can't come up with clever analogies or witty remarks to keep people engaged. I can't help but look at my past messages and just wondering how I could go back to that person I was before.  \n\nSame cycle of advice: Eat better bro, sleep better, drink more water, exercise. Keep doing something to keep your mind off it. \n\n \n\nLiterally nothing could go wrong, except that for the first time in my life it did, and it feels like I'm in a dark pit and slowly everything I've built is withering away and I'm just drowning in my thoughts and my demons. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't face my friends anymore, can't keep up conversationally, have nothing to add anymore even in a normal sense. I regret speaking to my close friends as I sense a shift in the way I'm treated, sort of like I'm special when I'm not.  Now I have a heightened fear of abandonment, and those feelings of being a burden for the first time in my life have crept up and are instilled within my brain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven when I was going through traumatic events, the one thing I held so dear to my heart was that I used laughter and communication as a coping mechanism. It felt like I could push through any obstacle. Till this day, I still believe that 99% of issues can be solved through communication.\n\nIt's all gone now, I forgot everything. Can't keep up. The sad thing about life is that it keeps going on and it's up to you to move on with it or not. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone went through a similar situation to me? How did you get out of it, I feel like no one in my life has dropped down to this extent like I did. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also want to apologize to anyone reading this and thinking \"What is this guy complaining about, so many people here probably have it 10,000 times worse.\" It's true, my life seems perfect on the outside, but inside I am empty.

Although you can't consciously determine what caused your fall from grace, I'd argue that there is a catalyst hidden there somewhere. We don't get any sort of feedback mechanism from the universe so it's often very difficult to truly tell why we are feeling so terribly.\n\nOne thing that comes to mind is something physically internal messing with your mind. For example, my digestion can get messed up easily. If it does, I can drop from feeling like a 10\/10 to a 1\/10 even though nothing about my circumstances have changed, and crucially, even though I realize that my gut is messed up. It doesn't matter -- I feel terribly. And I turn into an idiot, as if my brain is operating at 10% capacity, if that. Do you have anything physical like this that could have caused the fluctuation?\n\nSomething else that comes to mind is something you've hidden or suppressed that is trying to make its way out to heal. I had a very good life until I accidentally uncovered some traumatic events from that past that I had covered up. I became non-functional almost overnight and stayed borderline non-functional until I healed. I don't aim to diagnose you with early life trauma, but judging on what you wrote, it's a possibility. Ingrained trauma can destroy a beautiful house because the foundation is rotten.

When I opened up to my family, they pressured me into fixing the diet, even though the blood tests I took said that I wasn't deficient in anything. I also never eat vegetables, I've always had an instant reaction to it that makes me want to vomit. Other than that, I can pretty much eat anything and I used to be a huge foodie before. Lost that passion. \n\n3- I went to visit a friend for a week, and we ended up smoking up. That was probably the most traumatic event I went through because it affected me in a way where I was like maybe 1000x worse than what I feel right now, because in a cognitive aspect I felt like a vegetable. Could not move or talk. My friend was okay with it because I obviously hid the feelings I was going through, and I just chalked my dumbness to the marijuana.  Ever since that day, I've been slowly deteriorating. \n\n4- Later on, a friend came to visit me and I hosted him. I could not find anything to talk about in that moment, and that little hiccup caused my spiral. It was the first time ever that I found myself lost for words. Bless him, he then decided to talk to me about the game that I played for 14 years, league of legends. I should know everything about the game by nature, and could talk endlessly about any sub-topic that can be derived from that game. However, when he wanted to discuss something specific about a character, I found myself lost for words again. \n\nI also consciously chose to isolate myself and not talk to anyone trying to figure out what's exactly wrong with me. It's been tough trying to juggle the 2 lifestyles I've had before\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLifestyle #1: I was a very spontaneous person, I did what I wanted when I wanted. So things like a sleep schedule were non-existent to me. I slept whenever I felt like it. I've always been a gamer so I used to game all day because that gave me enjoyment. I used to watch endless shows and play a lot. Yet it feels like I forgot a lot of what I learned. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLifestyle #2: My family are trying to convince me to sleep earlier, you know casual parent advice like have a healthier diet. Exercise more, like going out for a run or a stroll in the gym.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only thing I find enjoyable now is escaping reality and sleeping, that feels like the only thing I remember how to do properly.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I don't really want to even continue if i'm being honest, people were like my favorite thing about school because of how different everyone was but most people here just aren't into being friends unless you would date them and even when i don't even go there i get ghosted, am i just too clingy or am i annoying??

If you do this for a couple minutes and review what you wrote a little later, you'll be surprised at the insight it grants you.\n\nI feel it's very important to pay at least some attention to imagining your ideal life, even if it seems foolish or the obstacles to get there seem insurmountable.

Just my opinion and I may lack context. :)\n\nMy 2c is it makes more sense to focus on your ideal life than the specifics of your current less-than-ideal life (such as phone bill payments), because once you figure out the path you want, these things will usually take care of themselves. For example, you know that joining the military or learning a trade isn't the right move despite the fact that they would make you independent.

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"1b3v8ww","Title":"Do I deserve it?","Author":"Jetblank","Timestamp":1709302431000,"Text":"Where to start. I've been to about 7 different schools in my whole life, and I've been bullied in some form in all of them. It sucks, but I'm used to the archetypes I come across, so the behavior doesn't shock me and thus affect me as much. But it does hurt. It hurts a fuck-ton.  \n\n\nI'm weird. I'm a weird kid, I've always been. For some reason, I just can't fit in with everyone else. I'll see other kids with their friends interacting naturally, but any time I try to be like them, and talk confidently and sincerely, I always get mocked or in some form ignored. It always feels like everything I say is off the mark, and I don't know why. It's terrible.  \nBut by far, the worst part of all of this is the fact that my dad is somewhat wealthy. I grew up in an average household, but about 10 years ago my dad got a job that got him a higher income. So to everyone else, I'm just a spoiled brat that lives on silver floors in a mansion. Because I live in a good house, eat 3 meals a day, and go to a high ranking school, everyone else sees me as a soulless spoiled brat, just like the terrible kids I go to school with.  \n\n\nI'm typically lonely. I move around alone a lot. I don't hate it, but it doesn't feel right sometimes. Now I do have some friends from my previous school, but my parents are really strict and don't want to me talking to them. One time after a bad day of getting bullied, I facetimed some of my friends to cheer myself up. I hadn't known that my mom had just come back from a trip. Because I didn't greet her upon he return, she smacked her fist on the door to my room until I opened it, and took my phone.  \n\n\nI feel like my parents are really bipolar. When I did something wrong as a child, they would sometimes give me talks and laugh with me, and sometimes they'd beat the living shit out of me. It's made me afraid of them, and I don't understand them. They'll be so wicked, whipping me like a horse, leaving visible marks on my body and face, and will cry over me later, like I'm evil and they're helpless.  \nOne time when I was 13, I told my mom I was depressed. She laughed at me and called my dad, who yelled at me and told me I'm on the internet too much. I brought up feeling like dying a year later, and she laughed at me once more, and called my dad. He started telling me it was disrespectful to say such, since my grandmother had gone through a lot to raise him and his siblings as a single mother, and didn't kill herself over it. After that, I realized they'd never give a damn. So up till today, I've never brought it up again.   \n\n\nAfter I graduated high school, my parents sent me to this religious camp in a third world country for a year. The place was horribly unhygienic, and we'd eat meals the size of our fists. I'd come back sick multiple times, and they'd send me right back again after a week or two. The last time I came back, I returned with a UTI, Malaria, Typhoid and Anemia, not to mention the anger issues and sleeping problems. One time when I came back, I was going to cut myself out of frustration, knowing I'd be sent back to suffer in a few days. As fate would have it my uncle walked in on me, and told my parents after I had gone back. My mother called me on a phone and told me I shouldn't try it, as it's temptation from the devil. She told me my father had said I would never kill my self, as I wouldn't do such a thing to him and the family.  \nOne of the only reasons I haven't ended it all is because of my siblings. I love them too much, how would things be if I was gone? It would be selfish of me. Another reason is, my religion teaches that if you commit suicide, you'll go to Hell. Now no one would want THAT lol. If those two reasons weren't a thing, I would've ended this shit ages ago.  \n\n\n  \nEveryday feels like a 5th grader drew it, and then a 4th grader drew the next day, and then a 3rd grader the next, and so on and so on. Meaning they just get worse and worse. I don't usually feel genuine happiness, and I use shows, movies, games and comics to distract myself from the ways I feel. Like it's escapism. I feel like nobody really likes me, or gives a fuck about me. I think I'm really self aware, and I know I don't behave like an asshole. I'm empathetic. I don't say rude things to people, I don't talk about people behind their back, I don't put people down to make myself feel better, I don't do any of that fake shit. It's the assholes\/bullies that do it, and it feels like the universe lets them get away with everything.  \n\n\nBack to the worst part of all of this. I deserve it. I live in a good house, with good education, and I'm fed. It always feels like I deserve all the shit that comes to me, because my family is well off. I'm fully aware that millions of people have worse problems than myself, and I might just be a sick spoiled young brat. That's what it might just be, because that's what I always fucking hear. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut fucking whatever honestly.

Expressing love, being emotionally vulnerable, present, and trusting are all wonderful traits. Don\u2019t let their actions convince you that being a loving individual is a weakness. Your efforts weren\u2019t appreciated by the ones who hurt you, but that\u2019s exactly why they\u2019re no longer in the picture\u2014 we shouldn\u2019t try to force an ill-fitted puzzle piece when the shape doesn\u2019t fit. The right people will celebrate you, make your compassion feel like a strength rather than a weakness, and reciprocate in kind.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s been in similar situations as you, I just want to say that it\u2019s taken me years to recognise that in order to love others in their entirety, I must first be able to extend that same respect and love to myself as well, along with enforcing boundaries. It\u2019s not weak to love, but we must ensure that we\u2019re watering our own garden before tending to someone else\u2019s. Loving others also means loving yourself enough to recognise that sometimes we need to stop giving second, third, and fourth chances to people who don\u2019t deserve it; sometimes it means we choose the hard path to walk away from someone even if we care about them deeply. \n\nIt hurts, and not everyone holds your heart with good intentions, but that\u2019s precisely why it\u2019s important for us to be able to recognise when to remove ourselves from people who provide more stress\/anxiety\/uncertainty than proper friendship. It\u2019s not easy, and the journey to that road of healing can be filled with doubt, but once you start seeing these patterns and begin to choose yourself first? Future-you will thank you for putting your needs as a priority for once. You deserve friendships\/relationships that are loving, equal in nature, and make you feel safe. For all the kindness you can give to others, it\u2019s time for you to invest that in yourself too <3","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

Reading my story and providing any feedback will brighten my day\u2026\n\nWhen I was born I had a stroke which would alter my life forever. The stroke effected my right limbs which has caused slight motor impairments. I am unable to fully extend my right arm or move fingers on my right hand individually or bend my right foot upwards and I walk with a limp. I have difficulty completing tasks that usually require both hands, such as job duties or typing on a keyboard. Some tasks may take me a little bit longer than the average person, but I will do my best to complete them. Another downside to my lesser abilities is that when I\u2019m nervous the right side of my body locks up like a temporary form of paralysis. This includes walking down flights of stairs, because my foot can\u2019t bend properly to maintain balance or when multiple people are looking at me in a public area. \n\nLet me back track and give a condensed biography of my life from a young age to modern day at 24 years old. When I was around ages 5-8 I had to wear a leg brace to help me walk correctly. I would have physical therapy around this time also to strengthen my right side and have to visit the children\u2019s hospital for routine checkups. When I was in school other kids would notice my brace and think differently of me. This made me feel sad at the time, but now I know I can\u2019t blame the innocent mind of a child. It was difficult making friends in elementary, but I luckily befriended one other kid in second grade. It has been years since I\u2019ve seen or spoke to him, but I\u2019ve seen his success in life over social media and wish him the best. My friend from elementary moved away in my middle school and junior high days and I never made any other friends. I attempted to be the class clown in order to not feel like an outsider or loner. I was able to make others laugh at\/with me, but I had no real friends and when I got off the bus after school I had nobody to play games or jump on the trampoline with. At that time, I found happiness in playing madden, wrestling, and collecting Pok\u00e9mon cards, which I\u2019ve kept to this day. During junior high (7-8 grade) I joined athletics to try and fit in with the \u201ccool kids\u201d. Long story short, I was the furthest thing from a freak athlete. I was one of the slowest and weakest kids in the program, but I pushed through. However, I met one of my best friends to this day while playing football. He was new in 7th grade and was kind of an odd kid like myself. This kid was very strong though and was a damn good athlete and earned respect from our colleagues. He remained my only friend until high school. \n\nDuring my freshman year I was getting bullied more than I did in any other grade. I would often get jumped at in the hallways to get a scared reaction from me, get shoulder bumped, get food thrown at me from across the cafeteria, or mocked for the way I walk to get a laugh from their friends. Not only did I have to endure this, but girls saw me as undesirable as well. This is where I developed social anxiety which I still suffer from, but for other reason I\u2019ll explain later. During my last two years of high school nobody really messed with me and I was actually respected as a change of pace. The worst I experienced at the time were questions like \u201cWhy do you walk funny?\u201d or \u201cWhy do you walk like you have a stick up your ass?\u201d. When I told them the reason why I could see their smiles fade followed by an apology. However, I took no offense and laughed it off. I made two more friends at this time which I\u2019m still close friends with today. \n\nIn college I was able to obtain two degrees and even got to hangout with a few girls I met there. This was new and exciting for me because I never had the opportunity before. Still, I never made it past the friend zone. My social skills weren\u2019t great, but they were improving. I would consider myself a decent looking guy, so I decided to try dating apps such as tinder and bumble. I\u2019ve had luck here and there. I was able to go on dates with ladies I believe are beautiful and it was quite a confidence boost. I\u2019ve had a few hook ups, not that I\u2019m trying to gloat. I even managed to find a girlfriend on tinder, although it lasted only months. This may sound very depressing, but I have gone weeks without receiving a match and months at a time without getting a text or Snapchat from a girl I\u2019m attracted to. I\u2019m happy when I match with someone after having no interactions for awhile. Usually when I grow interested in someone they become uninterested. While I\u2019m limited to only one option at the time (which I\u2019m grateful for) I realize she\u2019s more than likely getting attention from a list of guys. As of now, my confidence is pretty low and I haven\u2019t slept with anyone in over a year. I rarely get compliments from girls my age and usually they\u2019re sympathy compliments from women 65+. I rarely leave the house for anything besides work, getting groceries, or hanging out with friends. When I\u2019m out in public and make eye contact with someone they usually look down or turn their head the other way. I rarely get smiled at, instead it\u2019s groups of people smiling or laughing while looking in my direction while I\u2019m eating by myself. I\u2019ve even been asked by waiters\/waitresses why I look so sad. I tell them that I\u2019m fine and nothing is bothering me. It\u2019s honestly demoralizing and I find it hard to smile. I find solace in video games, watching sports, listening to nostalgic songs, rock, heavy metal, and working out alone in the comfort of my home. I do get very lonely often and have had thoughts of (you know)\u2026 but I don\u2019t want to burden those I love and am thinking of them before myself. However, I\u2019m glad to be here today and to have typed a condensed story of my life.\n\nI am extremely appreciative of anyone who took time out of their day to read my entry. Whoever you are or wherever you may be, whether you can or can\u2019t relate to me, just know that I am blessed that you exist.","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

Had a total meltdown. \n\nToday I\u2019ve decided to do nothing other than recover from this brutal hangover. I won\u2019t be buying any more alcohol. I\u2019m going to go to bed early tonight and I\u2019ll get back on my proverbial horse tomorrow. After all of the hard work I\u2019ve put in over the past several years, it would be a shame to throw in the towel now. Yeah, times are tough in Canada at the moment. The economy is going to shit and the housing market is looking bleak. I can\u2019t control these things BUT I can control my efforts and I can control my thinking with the help of a professional and the support of loved ones.\n\nAfter taking an honest look at my situation, I\u2019ve decided that it will be best if I pull a few g\u2019s from my investments for  a full psyche assessment and continued psyche care. Obviously I\u2019m not in my right mind anymore and last night\u2019s meltdown was proof of it. I can\u2019t afford to wait a year or more for government funded assistance, so I may as well put a few g\u2019s towards patching up mental health instead of throwing my entire future away. I know I can get through this. I just need professional help and I need to be more vulnerable with my loved ones and ask for support when I need it. I\u2019m soooo bad at asking for help but I have to toss my pride and just admit that I\u2019m struggling. \n\nI\u2019ve got two jobs (both commissions\/independent contract work). There\u2019s still money to be made here so I\u2019m going to continue to work my butt off and put money away. I\u2019ll reassess in 2-3 years with respect to a possible move. Either way, I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m going to keep moving forward. No more melt downs or future tripping. I\u2019m going to get help and go back to living in day-tight compartments. Tomorrow will also be the start of my reddit detox lol\u2026 I love reddit but since I can\u2019t seem to focus on positive content right now, so I need to take a temporary hiatus.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

The cost of housing was still decent. I felt like I still had a shot at a good life and I cleaned my act up, worked hard, saved a bunch of money and went back to school. Once I finished school, the housing market blew up. I tried to get my foot in the market but couldn\u2019t get approved for a mortgage even though I can afford it and have a decent down payment (20 percent down). The bank took one look at my independent contractor status and my part-time income for the past 3 years (due to being a part time student) and said hell no. I need at least one year of full time earnings to show the bank if I want to get approved but the market has shot up even more just over the past year. Condos that were in my price range are now 60-80 grand more. I can\u2019t keep up anymore and I\u2019m scared to even try now. I\u2019m scared to want for something that I fear I will never have. It\u2019s too heartbreaking. I want to own a home, live independently and just lead a simple and stable life. I\u2019ve yet to find a new AA sponsor in this city (I moved back to Canada, not by choice, from the US). I have thought about going back to AA and working the steps again but I just can\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel. If all my life will ever be is running myself ragged and seeing no reward, stability or growth, why continue living? Why try or stay sober. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not putting this on you or trying to be a Debby downer. It\u2019s just simply how I feel. Maybe there\u2019s something I\u2019m missing and there is hope. But I\u2019ve done the math. At this point, I need a miracle. That or I stay sober and accept this new harsh reality in Canada.  Idk\u2026 Maybe one of my debilitating hangovers will motivate me to go back to AA one of these days.

I\u2019ll start this off by saying I want to die, plain and simple. I genuinely don\u2019t see anyway my life could improve or get better from here and it\u2019s all my fault. \n\nMy family doesn\u2019t believe in mental health. My mother has a history of mental illness and childhood trauma that she refuses to work through and my dad will never ever stand up to her. My two older siblings left because they simply couldn\u2019t take it anymore and my mother still refuses to open her eyes.\n\nI graduated high school and tried community college and was miserable there. I can\u2019t drive because everyone simply refuses to teach me, so I commuted with a friend for the first few months but he dropped out because he was miserable at that particular school. Then my mom began taking me and you can only imagine how that went. I don\u2019t think there was a single day I didn\u2019t go into the bathroom and sob uncontrollably instead of going to class. If I wasn\u2019t doing that, id get so high so that I didn\u2019t have to think about anything and go to class.\n\nI barely passed the semester and then dropped out.\n\nI got a job so that I would at least have something to do but of course that was an issue. We get government benefits or something and my mom says if I work we\u2019ll lose the help because we\u2019ll go over the income limit. If I want to work I will simply be homeless so I have no choice. I\u2019ve spent months and months looking for off the books jobs, and there\u2019s nothing. I feel hopeless. I spend all my time in my bedroom crying and thinking of ways I can kill myself.\n\nAdding on I got a credit card stupidly because I was working and thought it\u2019d be good to build credit while I had a job. Completely wrong. I spent about $200 (on a $500 limit) and I missed a few $35 monthly payments and between that fee and interest I now owe about $700 dollars. I can\u2019t pay it because I have no job and no way of making money so the debt will just build and build and there\u2019s nothing I can do but dodge the calls and cry over it. \n\nTo top it off, my grandmother lives between my house and my aunts and guess whose room she takes over when she\u2019s here? Mine. She stays for weeks at a time and I can\u2019t complain or I\u2019ll be berated and made to feel like garbage. During these days I have to sleep in a twin sized mattress in my little sister\u2019s room while my little sister is forced to sleep on an air mattress in the living room. She hates it and I feel horrible and I don\u2019t want to sleep in her bed. \n\nI had a plan. I wanted to go to a medical school for 7 weeks and get certified as a PCT. It\u2019s not the best job but it\u2019s what interests me the most and in my area you can make about $21-$28 hourly depending on experience, but the school is about 25 minutes away from me and I already know nobody is gonna wanna commute me there, and nobody is gonna teach me how to drive so I\u2019m not even gonna bother getting my hopes up. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand why im still alive.  I\u2019ve prayed endlessly over and over for things to get better. I manifest, I affirm myself, and still things just get worse and worse. I\u2019m starting to believe that it\u2019s a sign I shouldn\u2019t be here because what\u2019s the point? I can\u2019t handle the pain anymore. My heart and head hurts. I just want to be at peace.\n\nMy days are the same. I wake up, shower, straighten up my room, smoke weed, go back to sleep, cry, and lately I\u2019ve started self harming again because it\u2019s the only thing that I can control. I don\u2019t eat. I don\u2019t cook. Lately I don\u2019t even bother getting out of bed other than to use the bathroom. I maybe go out three times a month if my friends invite me somewhere, but other than that this is my life.\n\nI don\u2019t even know why I wasted time typing all of this when it is extremely embarrassing. I just needed to get everything off my chest for once. Thanks for reading and please be nice if you choose to comment. ","Score":1,"Total_comments":2}

Then when the next shift comes on that usually has double the staff I get asked questions that I don't know the answer to because it was either too long ago or I never saw that patient at all. So I feel like a stupid asshole. Add on to that the crushing debt that my partner has basically entirely checked out of actually helping with even though the vast majority of it is there debt (think mid 6 figures, I owe less then 15% of the total.) Add to that my job means I get to attend people's deaths, Pretty much every day. The last several have been bloody gory deaths. And I have no outlet. I can't drink, it fucks up my already lacking sleep. I can't smoke, I get drug tested several times a year and clearing it out of my system takes about a month and a half. I've basically totally lost interest in video games cause none of my \"friends\" work the same shift as me so I was always alone and don't make friends easily. Not that I ever heard from them anyway. Eating is my only outlet, and I don't like cooking so that's an easy way to drop a bunch of money on food. On top of already being a fat dude. I'm just repeating this same cycle over and over again where I get sucked into a hole where it feels like there's a boulder on my chest for days. Then it lessons for a week or two, then I have mornings like this morning and I'm obviously completely incompetent and just a drain on everyone around me. I'm just so tired, all the time. And I don't know what to do about it. Already in therapy but it's inconsistent because it's expensive. No meds. \n\nWriting this out did help a little bit, now I really could use my bed.

This may mean that you were pressured,manipulated or guilt tripped into having sex or getting assaulted when you didnt know you were. Moving on,\n\nAround last year I met a guy that I thought really liked, and stupidly, I confessed to him when we didn't even know each other that long yet.  I think this was because he really manipulated me a lot throughout the time we were friends, which led to a lot. During my school fair, he randomly asked me if he could sit on my lap, and me being a people pleaser, scared to make him mad I just agreed, moments later he kissed me and I didn't really like it either. After that he asked me to touch him in public and covered us in his jacket while he made me touch his parts when I felt really uncomfortable doing it because for one, IT WAS IN MY SCHOOL. But if i didn't, he'd guilt trip me over and over again saying how i made him feel useless and stupid and I really didn't want to upset him. \n\nA few days later, I found out that he had been cheating on me with another girl, yet when i confronted him about it he cried and cried to me that \"he was sorry\" yet he didnt want to lose me. After this I eventually found someone else that I felt really safe with, yet when I told our mutual friend about my new guy, she sent it to my ex and he cried to me. He said specifically \"I felt like I've been hit by a truck rn\" when he saw the screenshots of me telling our mutual about me and my new partner. He told me he was going to lose it, so i really had to break it off with my new guy and get back together with him so I wasn't going to risk him killing g himself. That whole conversation was just him guilt tripping me into getting back together with him, and i really regret it.\n\nThis started a lot of manipulation. Every time he kissed me randomly and if i'd pull away, he guilt tripped the shit out of me and made me feel like I was a horrible person for not being able to let him do things to me. This happened for a while until one day, he manipulated me into letting him r@pe me, and every single time, I had to agree to it or else he'd make me miserable. I was pressured and manipulated into having sex multiple times when I didn't want to, I let him touch me when I really wasn't ok with it. My mom warned me and I tried to listen, but I was too scared at that point.\n\nSooner or later i broke up with him officially. And you know what i found out? he was cheating on me with THAT mutual friend who told him about my new partner. After that he had the audacity to say that he liked her more than me and that he should've said it at the start. He started a rant how much better she was compared to me and i lost it and just blocked him.\n\nI was enraged, but I was free, but why wasnt i happy?\n\nfew months later i discovered that he had actually made me depressed in that relationship and gave me some ptsd. I figured out that I was also a victim of sexual coercion and that I was facing severe depression, i just didnt know it,  but hey, after a while i was doing better too. \n\nThis is just a message to people who are probably experiencing toxic relationships too, if your gut tells you that theyre bad for you, go with it and stop torturing yourself. It'll get better.\n","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"1b3ri3g","Title":"How did you escaped from the clutches of your inner demons? Need some advice.","Author":"ImeFerrerLara","Timestamp":1709290421000,"Text":"I am a 27-year-old female (as evident from my username; I forgot to use a unique name when I created an account here on Reddit). These past few days, I always find myself crying at night, especially when I am alone. Once, my mom caught me crying, and I told her it's just a simple cold. I resigned from my traditional 8-5 office job because of a particular \"person.\" This individual holds a higher position in my department. She admitted that I am good at my work, but most of the time, she sees me as a parasite in the workplace. She consistently criticizes my attitude, but in reality, if I had a bad attitude, I wouldn't get along with my coworkers, and I have only received one case report against me. She is a biased person and only sees the mistakes I made throughout my career. I was not working as a regular employee in my previous job, but I enjoyed almost the same benefits as regulars. I applied for a regular position three times and always got denied. This \"person\" has an influence on why I'm always getting rejected. Last December 2023, I reached my peak. We talked face-to-face, and she was gaslighting me. It made me question my reality. I know for myself that I did not say those things, and yet she believed the reports that reached her. I tried explaining the incident to her, but no matter how I explained, she didn't understand me. I was mentally exhausted at that time, so I decided on the spot that I would resign. I did not even think through my decision. I just followed my impulsive decision. Even my friends and family convinced me not to resign, but I had made up my mind.  \nFast forward to two months later, I thought I was going to get a remote job, but I failed. If only I knew that getting a remote job was going to be tough, I should have never resigned and endured this \"person's\" perspective of me. Now that I am almost running out of funds to pay my bills, I started to apply for jobs in the outside world. I applied for an administrative staff position in a private hospital because my previous job was in the hospital industry as well. During the initial interview, of course, I did not tell the lady the main reason why I resigned from my previous job. I just told her that I wanted to pursue a different career path, and my long-term goal is to get a permanent position. As much as possible, I did not say anything bad about my previous employer. I haven't heard anything back from them, but I tried to follow up twice already. I think my previous employer might have said negative things about me, which is why I do not receive any updates.  \n\n\nI feel so useless. I used to be so good at my job, but after 2 months of being unemployed, I realized I am just a nobody. I am willing to accept a job that pays less than what I earned from my previous job, and yet nobody wants to hire me. I have experienced 20+ rejections in applying for remote jobs. The private hospital that I was hoping would hire me doesn't respond to my follow-up. I don't know why our lives are miserable. My parents depend on me. I am in charge of paying our monthly electric and internet bills. I also have a cash loan that I need to pay. I know resigning from work without a backup job is the worst decision. I am left with no choice but to leave. I cannot take how this person sees me. I did everything I could in my previous employer; I always take home work just to finish on time. I even find myself working during holidays and weekends, yet they don't appreciate my achievements. It feels like they hired me because I was dependable and willing to work like a slave, but they're never going to promote me to a regular position.  \nAnother thing adding to my depression is our family's financial difficulty. My mother is a retired government employee. She doesn't get any pension until 2026. She availed 5 years of lump-sum retirement benefits. She already used all of her money and is left with nothing but to wait for 2026 before she could receive monthly pension. My dad is a rigger in the US Naval Base Guantanamo Cuba. I cannot remember how much he earns, but most of what he earns goes to my brother's medical expenses. My brother needs constant kidney dialysis three times a week. On top of that, he has medicines to take. He is unemployed, but he has a wife who is not willing to help him pay for his medical expenses.  \nMy inner demons are always whispering that I should just stop and leave everything so I wouldn't have to face these difficulties in life.","Score":6,"Total_comments":1}

I've met some people who I don't believe have ever suffered from any mental health issue and yet are super caring and kind and understandind because that's just how they are. Yet the more I interact with people from all backgrounds the more I think that only those who know what it feels like to feel truly alone and hopeless know how to treat people with proper kindness, or at least in a way that doesn't include the other person leaving a conversation and feeling even more shitty and worthless.\n\nI've been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts ever since I was 13 and now to this day (ten years later) I think I can say with some degree of confidence that the only people who ever seemed to truly care about how I felt even tho they didn't know me very well (mental health \"professionals\" included) were those who I know have been through the same shit and know what it is like. Everyone else feels like they're from a different fucking dimension of emotional shallowness (which is something said by me of all people). I'm not talking about big shows of unearned affection or interest (which nobody expects from strangers or acquaintances of course), but I don't think it's too much to expect normal politeness and concern towards fellow human beings in general. Unless you have something tangible in common with them most people will normally not give you the time of day or show any kind of interest in your life and wellbeing at all, or rather they will but only if it serves them some kind of purpose (e.g. if you're like me and are neurodivergent you know how most people tend to treat us as comedic relief or simply question every little thing we do just to point out how weird it is). It's so painfully obvious how not only their interest in you as a person (which I think is legit) but their empathy and compassion are very conditional too. Most people don't really give a shit about how others feel if they can't relate to them and will not even try to hide it, but those same people will describe themselves as welcoming and kind individuals, or say they care all the while not ever giving you a second thought when interacting with you.\n\nI think it actually all boils down to ingroup-outgroup mentality or something but holy shit is it that hard to be considerate about how you make others feel? Like how stupid do you have to be to not realize that you will meet countless people who are already this close to offing themselves but are still trying their best, only to have a rude and self centered person make them feel even more like shit than they already do? Just stop pretending you care about others if this is the regard you show them.","Score":33,"Total_comments":1}

Back in high school I pulled myself out of my misery and got in shape, but then I had a motivation. I had a crush on a female friend of mine, and her constant praise and support at me bettering myself drove me forward. I didn't care about getting in shape. I didn't care about myself at all. The only reason I went from an overweight loner to a confident person who was the best player on our football team was the thought that if I could change myself enough then she would be attracted to me. I spent my entire time from 9th to 12th grade becoming one of the most physically fit guys in the entire school, heck I won our schools weight lifting competition. The whole time she cheered me on, and made me feel like I was accomplishing something. Then in senior year I did it. I asked her out one day after our football team won. I was so sure that she would say yes. I had spent all this time listening to what she said about what she found attractive in a man to her other friends, and I did everything to meet those standards. I have never felt as confident as I did in that moment, but of course she rejected me. She smiled and said she didn't want to ruin our good friendship, and that was that. Everything else in my life was miserable but the thought that I would win her over kept me going, and with her rejection of me I just stopped caring. I had spent years working out, and taking care of myself, because I thought I had a chance with her. In the end, even at my best, I wasn't good enough. I still carry that thought with me now even 8 years later. Even my best isn't good enough. I let myself go and slowly returned to being an out of shape loser. I even stopped talking to most of the other friends I had made on the football team. It is pathetic, but I never recovered. Now at 26 I am busy with my job and taking care of my elderly grandmother, so I have little time for anything else. I keep trying to get started on getting in shape and getting a girlfriend, but I just can't seem to find the time or motivation to do it. I feel as though I am unworthy of happiness. I feel like a failure. I mean I can't even summon the resolve to ask women out. I don't care about myself, and I want to find someone else to care about instead.\n\nAdvice? \n\nI don't think anything will help, but it is worth a shot I suppose.\n\n&#x200B;","Score":4,"Total_comments":0}

I have no support network. My parents are dead. They were unsupportive, poor and left me nothing. For the past years, every person or friend I met in my life, or every relative I had, has had it way better. Either they had money or at least a nice family, a good job or something.

Or given money or at least help, support and kindness. And I? I could never count on my family. My family gave me depression only and instilled insecurity in me for the rest of my life. I feel too old to fight it. I don't want to fool myself with hope anymore. I'm sick of seeing happy and lucky people with things they consider standard and take for granted while to me those things are luxury I'll never have.

It is amazing that you are as functional as you are. I know it probably doesn't make you feel better but I'm being 100% serious.\n\nAnd yes, seeing other people with better circumstances can be extremely frustrating, because it is not fair that they do not have to deal with the litany of problems that you have to deal with, simply because you happened to be spawned by two imbeciles.\n\nI felt exactly like you for quite a long time, we are about the same age. I think where we differ is that I self destructed sooner. Self destructing essentially forced me to address my problems that stemmed from childhood because I became completely non-functional.\n\nIn particular, I realized I had cPTSD to a quite severe degree. Nothing was working to resolve that until I discovered IFS (internal family systems). I was flat broke so I sort of did it on myself with a pad and paper and let the different parts talk, instead of going to a therapist.\n\nThe books No Bad Parts, along with Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents, were the game changers for me. First one for practical steps, second one for that cathartic feeling.\n\nI think it will be easier for you than it was for me because you already realize that the people who spawned you were sh\\*tbags.\n\nOnce you're over the trauma, The Law and The Promise (book by Goddard) will maybe help you build your ideal life. But it's very difficult to follow that book if you have existing trauma in the way. And judging by what you wrote, you almost certainly have unaddressed trauma that is handicapping you at every single turn.\n\nJust my 2c, feel free to ignore this entire post if you didn't find it helpful.\n\nGood luck <3 <3 <3 Love you <3 <3","Score":16,"Total_comments":0}

I'm struggling bad. I've barely gone to any of my classes, in one class i've done maybe one assignment, because I don't know what the assignments are because I rarely go to class.\n\n I sleep until 1pm most days, except now I drag myself to some classes because if I don't i'll be kicked out of them. I ace my tests and the stuff i do hand in comes out great, but that doesn't matter much when i'm not doing 90 percent of it.\n\n I got dxd with severe anxiety and moderate depression so got put on prozac 10mg this past month, and it was starting to help. I was starting to show up, do things i needed to do, take care of myself, until I upped my dose to 20mg, which caused severe dizziness and sickness and i couldn't go to class, and this past week i became so depressed I had to see the crisis counselor on campus.\n\n I lowered my dose back to 10mg but that was only a couple days ago, and right now I'm looking at all the shit i fucked up for myself. I've dug myself so deep I don't think there's a way out. I'm working with the dean of students and with my counselor, and my advisor, but I haven't met with the dean of students yet to work anything out. I don't want to take a break. That's not something I want to do.\n\n The sad part is? I LOVE the content in my classes. Greek mythology? Hell yeah! Archeology? One of my passions! But I don't enjoy them at all. I dread having to get out of bed. Part of it is because it's winter, it's cold out and miserable and I physically don't want to walk in this shit. \n\nBut yesterday I walked OUT of the end of my midterm and left a note in the essay section saying I felt sick. Which I did. I keep feeling like I'm going to be sick, and my stomach hurts, and the dizziness is just wearing off now. I hate myself! I avoid my responsibilities and play around on my computer or talk to my friends when i KNOW I should be working on stuff, but i just plain don't, and then I hate myself for it.\n\n I feel like a prisoner in my own mind. I know the right things to do I just don't do them. And things I used to enjoy i don't anymore. Writing? I feel like the worst writer in the world, art? haven't touched it in months, cooking? I'm lucky if I can get myself to eat saltines these days. I've lost eight pounds in the past week. \n\nMy room is a trash heap, haven't done my laundry in two weeks, in every area of my life I am failing, and I am a disaster. My GPA is for sure going to drop this semester. I don't understand it. I used to be an academic weapon! But now I'm an academic mess. Help. Please. I don't know what I'm doing.

I know how you feel with the fear that you are faking it, but your psychiatrist knows you are not. Antidepressants can make you feel not yourself at times but if that happens talk to your doctor and find one that works for you, or you don't have to take them at all. SSRI's are not cures for depression, they are something that helps you make it through a day. While you are taking them look for healthy coping mechanism that will help you out of the depression.  Also, most likely since you are just now going on Lexapro you will receive a low dosage. There are side effects but nothing detrimental will happen to you even if you do not need them. Lexapro is an SSRI which basically just trap serotonin in your brain, if you are not really depressed it can cause something called serotonin syndrome, which can cause confusion and agitation. If you are very worried about this I suggest talking to you psychiatrist more before starting them. Hope this helps, and btw I believe you are depressed.","Score":6,"Total_comments":0}

In fact, the only salvation from suffering is that we may draw the strength that lets us consciously learn from suffering.

Rape and war wouldn\u2019t, either. \n\nBut anyway, I often check my gallery and Instagram stories from a year ago and get really melancholic and thoughtful. \n\nI thought about how my heart yelled for her to come back, to say something - anything.

Bad people won\u2019t apologize because they knew they did wrong, or they never cared.\n\n\nJust like I had fantasies of death everyday and felt like it would bring peace to all my suffering, having her say something really felt like it would help. But she never did. And I never went back to her, because she never felt sorry for toying with my feelings. And never cared. \n\n\nI guess that as a last act of respect and love for my depression, existential crisis and pain, it is fitting that she never came back. It kinda gives me peace as well, in a weird sense. I guess that a part of me died with her, because she meant love and compassion for me. She meant there being significance to romantic love. I am okay with it ending forever. A part of me has thought maybe from October to now that I kinda wish she forgot about me forever.

It was the darkest point in my life, I had turned to drinking like never before; didn\u2019t shower or shave for pretty much the entire months-long ordeal.\n\nThen I applied for college, for the first time in my life, and slowly but surely my mood started improving.

I was very much looking forward to a weekend of activities and socializing. But in the middle of class today, I get a message that they were unable to secure travel accommodations for me. To say I was devastated was an understatement. I just sat frozen, time started moving slow; I just wanted out of there. I bolted out of campus as soon as I could, I wanted to just go home. But on my way home, I stopped by the liquor store to grab my ol\u2019 reliable from those dark months this time last year. I had to call my grandparents to inform them things have changed, as I was planning on staying the night at their place the day before I was to leave; but after that, I ghosted everyone.

It's not like I play it all day , I only play games with my friends at times. But they really verbally abuses me loudly for that sometimes even when the mac's on (discord) Also they tell me get out of the house at every argument. Moreover  my mother is racist towards my girlfriend (23). I cannot leave my girlfriend for her, she is too precious to me and supported me at everything for which i am passionate about, more than my mother for the last 8 years and she is probably the only one for whom i am still going on. Moreover, my parents body shames me because I grew a little healthy in the last 2 years. Furthermore, discriminates me with my younger sister a lot. She gets to decide her life choices at everything but i dont, even in the family matters. I dont have any argument with that But the verbal abuse in the family towards me is really making me depressed. At times they hit me physically as well and If i argue about it they verbally abuses me more and more. Even my sister does that too in front of my parents and sometimes at their knowings but they don't do anything about it much saying you are a guy, why are you complaining about it? But I cannot hit her which I feel unethical because in the end she is a female person and as a male I cannot hit her in any way right? All these are making me depressed at I get suicidal thoughts every now and then. What should I do? \n\nPs. I had a pretty traumatic childhood. I used to get beaten by sticks and cricket stamps if I come below 5th position in class which I did 3-4 times. I also got beaten for other purposes as well (such as coming home late at evening after sporting events, stealing little amount of money like 100 BDT (0.83 USD) from my father's pocket because they never gave me pocket money but all my friends had that and they used to spend it on their small needs in front of me, going to friend's place for internet because I did not have that until college etc.)\n\nI thought about, if any of my friend's parents do such stuffs and even asked them about it. But I couldn't find any. They post beautiful posts sharing how much they love their parents on social media but I don't get any motivation to that because I truly don't feel like liking them at times. They never truly supported me in any of my passions (drawing, streaming, football, etc.) All these pushing me towards drugs. I have some friends who does drugs for recreational purposes but I started doing it with them for my depressions. I tried talking it out with my friends and girlfriend but they all equally feel saddened about it and what else can they do? They don't come to my house because my parents ask them u comfortable questions about me and they don't want to put me in any more trouble after what I go through everyday. I feel all these are making me addicted towards drugs and porn which I really don't want but ... I don't know what to write about it.

I will say something I haven't even told my parents, or my closest friends.\n\nWhen I was about 5 or 6, this girl, who I am not going to say the name of, would come over basically every day. When parents weren't looking, or we were alone for a bit, she would touch me inappropriately, and had it in my head that sex was a normal and common everyday thing. This ended up with me growing up and believing that sex was everything. As I grew up, relations with family members, cousins, siblings, even parents were breaking. I always viewed everything in a romantic way, causing me to feel awkward around my parents. I never opened up to them, and I don't know why.\n\nIn my early ten years, like, 11 or 12, I got into middle school, meaning that we could actually see each other for the first time in years. Not only would she tell her friends about the stuff that happened years ago, but she would also pin it on me, making me look like a total fucking creep in front of some of my friends. I just recently found out that the way I am around people could be a result of what she did to me, taking my innocence at a young age. She took so much from me, and I can't get it back. I hope she dies a horrible death along with her friends who support her. Now, I discovered just a few days ago, that I may have nostalgic depression. I get really said when I think of times when I had my innocence, and wasn't to set on sex all the time. What do I do?\n\nFor anybody wondering, she is now doing drugs and sucking random peoples' cocks at age 14 on the streets.","Score":0,"Total_comments":0}

I have been working abroad away from my home country for 5 years now. Living alone and having to take care of everything on your own is depressing. I have few friends here but they are all in a relationship, so most of the time I don\u2019t want to meddle around their quality time.

Most of the men here were muslims or just after beautiful EU females or just looking for someone to have \u201cfun\u201d with. And neither of that describes me.

I just wanted to do this post because I just feel lonely and I have no idea why.\n\nTo start off with, I\u2019ll try to summarise my life in a paragraph. Growing up I had a horrible dad who never looked after us, he never bought me anything and used to hit me, lock me up and never let me out. I\u2019d get beat if I went outside. Never fed us properly and would leave the country for a long time and we\u2019d see him for like 3 months of the year. He treated my mum terribly wnd cheated on her and he left us when I was 8. I am now mid twenties and I\u2019ve been through a lot since then. I\u2019ve had people dear and close to me steal from me, betray, use me and so on. I don\u2019t want to go too much into detail as to what I\u2019ve been through in case it becomes obvious for the people who may recognise me through this. But it in short words I\u2019ve been through a lot of scenarios, seen a lot of things I shouldn\u2019t have. I\u2019ve seen things happen to my own mum, I\u2019ve seen people close to me almost kill themselves, give in to substance abuse, depression. Ive been treated really badly in relationships in the past, but It is what it is. It just helped me become a stronger man. I\u2019ve looked after people constantly my whole life and after I\u2019ve helped them, most have left. The ones who stayed were my family because at the end of the day, they are my family :). I have a few good friends left bless them, one friend that has been there in my good and bad times since childhood. \n\nSorry that\u2019s long ^ but that\u2019s just the absolute tip of the iceberg but I tried to summarise.\n\nNow I\u2019m at a point in life where I\u2019ve overcome everything, I\u2019m very successful god bless. I\u2019m in amazing shape, I\u2019m strong, have decent looks. I have my dream job, I have a beautiful car at a young age, I have my fianc\u00e9e who\u2019s an angel and we\u2019ve been so happy together the entire time. She is my whole heart. I have my immediate family who are great people. Honestly, couldn\u2019t complain about life, god bless.\n\nBut for some reason, I just feel sad most of the time. As loving as everyone is in my life right now, I feel like it\u2019s hard for anyone to understand what\u2019s going on in my head. I do open up don\u2019t get me wrong, and they\u2019re there for me. \n\nBut for some reason I just feel like it\u2019s hard for me to be happy, I feel so ungrateful because I now have everything I could\u2019ve dreamed of, there\u2019s literally people dying in the world from terrible disasters. I have so much more than most of the world.\n\nBut I just feel sad, depressed, useless. I don\u2019t know why I feel like this? \nI should be grateful for what I have right? \nIs it because I\u2019m weak? \nI don\u2019t think I am because of everything I\u2019ve overcome, but at the same time (in the most non-suicidal way) I feel like I\u2019d be more at peace just being with god now? \n\nI don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s felt like this before, but you just feel tired?? \nLike just genuinely tired. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s been exhausting being there for everyone in my life whilst going through so much sh*T myself. I\u2019ve seen so many things, I saved one of my loved ones from killing themselves, I\u2019ve seen such horrible things, I\u2019ve been dealt such horrible things. But I\u2019ve always powered through it. I\u2019ve been there for a lot of people in my life, and never regretted it one bit. Even though it\u2019s tiring at times, but to this day I still try my best to help everyone around me, And they\u2019re all very grateful for it. Even for the ones who were ungrateful and used me, I do not regret helping them out one bit and never will, and i don\u2019t hold a grudge on them. Because at the end of the day, it was a part of my life journey and I will always want to help everyone I love, family, friends, lovers. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just all catching up to me finally? \nEven though I have everything you could possibly have in life, I\u2019m still ever so sad. But I hide it very well from everyone. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so sad and depressed, why I feel like not being here. I\u2019ve been in anti-depressants and beta-blockers (for anxiety) in the past.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that this is so long, I don\u2019t even know if this post makes sense. But I thought id get some strangers opinions on why I\u2019m feeling like this, regardless of what I have? \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just simply depression, or ungratefulness? \n\nI don\u2019t know, but who ever reads this and responds, I hope you have a nice day and thank you for taking the time to give me your  perception of your world and experiences in life\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffe \n\n#depression #sadness #mentalhealth","Score":2,"Total_comments":5}

I have tried sooo many different prescribed medicine for my problems, but they all cause side effects, either attacking one or more mental illnesses (SSRIs gave me more depression and made me lose even more focus, but calmed my anxiety, Bupropion worked the other way around, ADHD meds only gave me anxiety) and\/or gave me horrible physical side effects, most of the time bad pains in abdomen.\n\nWould you say I qualify for status of a disabled person?

When I say that I mean the trauma literally started within the womb (was born with neonatal abstinence syndrome\/heroin withdrawal) . And honestly it only got worse from there. But the work I did? God I thought I\u2019d done so well to work through the many many awful events and circumstances. I\u2019ve had comments that I\u2019m surprisingly well adjusted and people shocked I didn\u2019t go off the rails. It\u2019s been a conscious push forward for a long time and at least 15 years analysing myself in depth. Can\u2019t afford therapy but occasionally have talked things through with friends who then passed on what they\u2019d learnt. Point is. There were tough times but I thought it was the past and I really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be back here. \nBut I am. And I know it\u2019s the loneliness and everything that stems from it. Cos of my trauma I find it really hard to attach at all. I have family members that are well. Around. But even the \u201cgood\u201d ones (more neutral I feel) are people I just could never feel safe with. So I have relatives but no sense of family or support system there. I have no partner (years of casual dating and either heartbroken over people who just didn\u2019t like me or escaping toxic\/abusive partners early on. Thankfully). So all that\u2019s left are friends right? The concept of friendship means the absolute world to me. It\u2019s so important.

And now I feel like my friends are gone or friendships are falling apart. Most people have relocated and slowly the bonds are harder to maintain. Most of my friends also have long term partners they understandably prioritise. It just feels more and more like my relevance in my friends lives is disintegrating. And part of the work I\u2019ve done (and might have done wrong) is to question the instincts that come from the hurt. So rather than self-isolating cos I\u2019m sad that I\u2019m lonely I tend to go towards. I will tell my friends i miss them and make an effort. And the more I make bids for connection the more it seems reinforced that my friends genuinely aren\u2019t bothered about me. None of them are cruel or selfish or anything like that it\u2019s just adult life I think. But my place amongst it all, entirely on my own is destroying me. And I can\u2019t help but question how much of this is my own fault . And is it this inescapable thing i\u2019m subconsciously doing to myself and will continue to repeat? And one of my biggest fears of all is that I\u2019ll end up just like my mother - spiteful and deranged and forsaken by everyone who\u2019s known her, this entirely alone. I know logically it\u2019s likely I\u2019ll meet new people and form new bonds. I just feel like I\u2019m in a ghost town knocking at doors , no one is answering and the road is near its end. Like no one will be important to me again and no one will ever really care or look out for me. God I\u2019m so scared. I need some tenderness. I need a hug. And I need a break from the everyday. But as simple as they are they don\u2019t feel achievable. \nThank you anyone who read my vent. I just needed to say something somewhere.","Score":3,"Total_comments":1}

It sounds like you've had a lot of pain and suffering in your life, I'm sad to hear.\n\nI think you shouldn't give up on connecting with others, and definitely don't feel like you're running out of time.  You're still young, but as you know, a lot of people around your age are having major life changes.  Young friendships are easy to maintain and find, but they're also more fickle and often surface-level.  They often decay with time, I think for everyone.  The ones that aren't like that, usually change once your friend gets married and\/or works a lot.  I can't speak from experience, but your friendships moving forward at least will be (hopefully) with people who understand themselves better, as adults, so perhaps the friendships can be more genuine, in a way.  You may not get to spend 5 hours a day with them, like you can when you're young, but life is filled with tradeoffs I guess.\n\nYou're right to value social connection so highly.  I've learned it's the most importnat thing, in the end, and I'm the last person anyone would think would say that.\n\nKeep trying.

I think it all started when i was in 1st grade elementary. my classmate blamed me when she got hurt. she and her grandma went to my house and told my dad i hurt her which is not true at all (she fell by herself and blamed me for it) my dad didn\u2019t even bother to ask my side or ask me if it\u2019s true. he apologized to them right away and when they left, my dad grabbed my umbrella and beat me with it. i was trying to tell my side while he was hitting me but he told me to shut up. he didn\u2019t stop until my umbrella broke. my mom was out of town thar time and she never knew about it. \nHe always blames me whenever something is missing at home (things, money etc.) he always points his finger to me when something broke at home, always blames me when something happens to my sister. \nI\u2019ve been modeling since i was 15 years old but 3 years ago unfortunately my career slowed down. i started getting depressed, eating disorder, anxiety\u2026 i started isolating myself in my room. i felt lost, i started loosing my passions and interest, i couldn\u2019t understand myself. i was crying day and night. \nI stopped accepting jobs for months because i wasn\u2019t mentally and physically stable at all.\nI was always awake at night till the sun rise then sleep in the morning. i was either binge eating or starving myself.\nNo one in my family ever checked on me. my dad kept on nagging me saying how lazy and how worthless i am. he kept on talking loudly from the kitchen to my mom about me, for me to listen from my room about their conversations. my depression and anxiety became worse and worse. i felt helpless. no one was there for me.\nToday my dad had me, my brother and mom talk in the living room because they noticed that my sister is developing depression too. he started talking by saying me and my brother should talk calmly to my little sister and never shout at her and he started blaming me again and really tried to blame my sister\u2019s depression to me. i really wanted to shed tears, my whole body was shaking. then he started talking shit about me again saying why i can\u2019t find job before when in fact i do have 2 regular jobs now. he kept on bringing up how arrogant i am that i look so high of myself that\u2019s why no one wants to hire me ( i sent my cv to so many, did interviews for months but couldn\u2019t find a job since in my country it\u2019s difficult.\nI couldn\u2019t help myself anymore, so i started talking back to him and telling my side but i was having anxiety so i started crying while talking and he was so pissed about it. he looked at me like i\u2019m so ridiculous. not even pity. he was gaslighting. i started telling about my depression throughout the years but u know what he said? \u201coh come on, you\u2019re just lazy and don\u2019t even try to excuse ur laziness by saying you were depressed!\u201d\nI was in shock but not too surprised. we kept going and fighting but he just never want to validate my emotions or understand my depression i had for years and he told me to fuck off and go to my room.. so i was like.. yeah that\u2019s it. that\u2019s my last straw.\ni went to pack my luggage. not thinking of anything else but just to get out of that house. \nminutes later my mom went to my room and saw me packing. she started talking and saying is this how you hate us? i don\u2019t hate my mom NEVER! but his husband? yes! i was just crying and packing my things my mom started crying. i couldn\u2019t think straight anymore and i just said i think it\u2019s better if i just die. both of you especially dad thinks i\u2019m worthless and all so i better just disappear! me and my mom were crying so hard but my dad was just there.. he couldn\u2019t care less. i told them i\u2019m gonna leave or just disappear and my dad is telling my mom to let me do what i want\u2026 \nmy siblings stopped me from leaving because of my mom. my mom said if leaving, she wants to leave with me too. i really love my mom and my heart was breaking when i saw her crying.\ni don\u2019t know what to do anymore. i feel so hopeless and tired. i don\u2019t know what to do anymore\u2026\n \n","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I'm 26 and I'm in a relationship, I grew up in a financially comfortable family with a wonderful mother and father, I was SAed a bunch of times by different family members while I grew up( not immediate family). I was bought up as a strict Catholic after I hit 14-15 I realised I wasn't very religious, not religious at all really. I grew up with no friends I did very good at school and sports but I never had any true friends when I was 17 my sister died due a genetic condition and when I was 18 I left my country and moved to Australia as an international student. Like every other international student I started from the bottom and worked my way up during my degree and a bunch of jobs but my mental health was okay for the most part. I met a Muslim girl at work and we became friends and realized neither of us were religious so we got together. I lost my virginity to her and we fell in love quickly. I trusted her with every aspect of my life but she lied to me from the beginning she lied about her past, she lied about hooking up with a mutual friend(before we got together) that became one of my best friends at work. When I came to realize that she kept that from me I was devastated and then later on I found out that she sent explicit pictures and videos of her prior to them hooking up that he still has in his phone cause she sent it via messenger. I forgave her and stayed with her. We went through a lot of upa and downs and when her family found out about me they made her break up with me. She was my first love and first relationship but we got back together very quickly then when her family tried to set her up with another guy she broke up with me again over text. At that point I hit rock bottom and I tried to kill myself 10-15 seconds before I was going to do it my mum saved my life (unknowingly) she called me just to check up on me and I broke down and told her everything I thought shed be angry that I was with a Muslim girl but she was just there for me. There was a lot of talk about Jesus but still she was there. To reasons I don't understand maybe because I was fucking stupid we got back together again and after we did she cheated on my emotionally with that guy they tried to set her up with. I caught her and she apologized and said she'd do anything to be with me and she made good on that promise. She gave me all her passwords for socials and have been good ever since. \n\nSkip to now we both moved in she had a huge falling out with her family when she moved in with me. Her sister cut her off. It's been a couple of months and she cooks, cleans, does my laundry does the shopping and does everything that I want her to do, including sexually. I graduated and went into a full time job with good money and has got another job with my dream company at high six figures. My family all thinks I'm successful and I'm happy. The truth is I'm overweight, no confidence pathetic shell of a human being who puts on a show for people, even for her. I don't feel like waking up everyday and I constantly want to just end it. I have taken measures that if I finally do do it all my finances, student loans clothes everything will be sorted. I even have taken care of howy coffin will go back to my home country with no cost to my family. I know I sound like I'm whining and there are people with far more worse problems than me. I just don't know what's wrong with me, right now I don't have a reason to be sad or depressed if that's what this is but I just don't know what to do here. ","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

The past five years have been the worst years of my life, with my mom passing just weeks before my high school graduation. From then on, a Domino effect of misfortune events. Had my little brother taken away in a super stressful custody battle against his step-dad (who I had a very abusive history with in the past). Then college starts, which should have been exciting right? It was for a little bit. Then I started getting extremely depressed and suicidal on campus, and I didn't take care of my mental health. That ended up costing me my spot in university, and all of the merit scholarships I accrued during my time at high school. Then I flunked out. Then I had to move and get a job that I honestly didn't really like, living paycheck to paycheck as a shell of my former self. All while dealing with family drama and the fact that I'm just worthless and let so many people down. \n\nNow, I don't care anymore. I know that things won't get better. I don't care if I'm selfish for thinking this way. I'm not gonna care anymore if caring will always lead to this degree of disappointment, frustration, and anger. Yeah. I'm out of a job now. Yeah, I'm homeless. I'm too far gone. My ambitions aren't worth a single damn, and I couldn't give a single damn right back.\n\nAnd the worst part is? I don't have the balls to end my own life. I'm a coward who wants to die but is too afraid to die. So you know what? Time for an action plan. At this point, I'm gonna force myself to die through psychological means. That's why I left my job and became homeless. I figured that if I force myself into a state of complete and utter hopelessness, I could then find the courage to end it all.

One day they are quoting from articles on how pain MUST be treated and how not treating it causes massive damage (brain damage, 10 % less brain volume, damage to the white matter of the prefrontal cortex, central sensitization, poor immunity, shrinking telemeres indicating a shorter life, muscle wasting)... and then a moral panic happens and they mysteriously forget their university classes what they were doing for the previous 15 years.\n\nThere are a lot of doctors who can't tell the difference between a good study and a bad study and a wild unsupported claim. only about 10% of docs ever do any science and that includes dealing with patients in some other person's study. most of the ones I've seen aren't good with mathematics. I've had GPs who can't figure out how many pills to write for a 28 day script at 2 pills a day while in an office with a big button calculator on their desk and a PC & cell phone with calc apps on them. they don't read. they have no appetite to learn. they do no research on anything. And frankly McDOnalds medicine in which every 5 minutes must be attached to a billable item just to keep the doors open, that's not conducive to learning, or actual medicine with research.\n\nAt the moment I sit here with cancer of the bone marrow for which I have never seen an oncologist or phlebotomist because GPs are amazingly ignorant people. I've lost about 60 pounds of solid muscle and none of them are interested in figuring out why. And my current GP has decided (despite evidence from a brain injury recovery unit) that I have an amazing memory. They also think that I'm probably autistic. Guess what? People with brain injuries often have problems with executive function & those with memory issues have to bulldoze over other in a conversation or just give up and watch from a distance. They will never remember what they were going to say if they wait for you to be done. They cannot tuck a thought away for later and wait their turn. The conversation between working memory and short term memory is utter shit.\n\nAnd how is it that \\*I\\* know this as a person who isn't an M.D. or anything related and she doesn't.

For a brief intro I am a 39 (m) and I could probably talk about my life and traumas though that alone might exceed the limitations of this post alone its safe to assume at least I have experienced and witness throughout the life might be equal, more or less  to what others on this reddit might have experienced the only difference being it was myself who went through them and more or less my choices after those events and how I lived my life is the only difference.  Anyhow the only thing I will clarify when I was younger I had anger management issues, was insanely competitive in any aspect of life and always sought to be better than everyone else.  (perhaps why I got into games later in life)  Part of why I changed was an event where I did something to my baby brother that ended up breaking apart my family, the injury was blamed on my mother's long time boyfriend (this is an entire mess I won't get into since that my mother's burden and I at least have grown enough that I don't have to bear her sin as well as mine.)  This caused myself, my little brother and baby brother to go into state custody and I will leave that to rest but only add it was these events that led me to make the choices I did in my life. \n\nBefore Christmas the company I had work for holds a Christmas party a week before and since I always attend I attended like every other year but something broke within me that night and I haven't been able to repair what broke.  Previously at any other event I am a very social person, being involved in the conversations and adding to them at times but that night I was quiet didn't eat anything and only drank two beers before the party wrapped up.  It was such a startling change in myself that even the big boss asked my boss what was up and was concerned since it was a huge departure from the person I am usually.  Safe to assume my time at work has been sporadic now since that party and I can't seem to fix what broke within me and not sure if I want it fixed anymore.  It pains me knowing the people at my work are hoping I get better and at times I think its better for them to let me go.\n\nWhat I couldn't tell them was that at the party it struck me that I am tired, in my life I never formed any deep connection with another person and I had gotten tired of always walking away from forming anything with another person.  I am tired of people saying I am a catch despite everything I have done to make myself appear less attractive to people.  I am tired of people asking me of my hobbies since I don't have any and tired of saying that I just do what strikes my fancy at the time.  Tired of seeing people better than me dying alone knowing if they had the opportunity they could have done so much more.

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"1b3eego","Title":"Navigating mental health as a student","Author":"JessA_93","Timestamp":1709247928000,"Text":"In the bustling hallways and the silent corners of the library, where the air is thick with the scent of books and caffeine, there's a story unfolding that often goes unnoticed. It's a story that many of us share but seldom speak about. Today, I want to break that silence and share my journey through the often turbulent waters of student life and mental health. My story is not unique, but it is mine, and it's about time it was told.  \nI am a 21-year-old woman who, like many others, embarked on the exciting yet daunting journey of higher education with dreams in my eyes and hope in my heart. What I didn't expect, however, was for those dreams to be clouded by an uninvited guest: mental health struggles.  \nAs exams loomed and deadlines approached, what started as mere stress evolved into something far more insidious. Sleepless nights spent staring at the ceiling, pages of notes blurring before tear-filled eyes, and an overwhelming sense of isolation became my new normal. Anxiety and depression, two terms I had heard but never truly understood, became my constant companions.  \nThe university, a place I had thought would be a haven of support and understanding, seemed indifferent to my struggles. Resources were either scarce or stretched too thin, and the few times I mustered the courage to seek help, I was met with long waiting lists and generic advice. I felt lost, alone, and misunderstood.  \nBut in the darkest of times, I found a flicker of hope in the digital world. Online forums, mental health apps, and virtual therapy became my sanctuary. It was through these platforms that I found not only coping mechanisms but a community of individuals who shared my experiences. They offered not just empathy but practical advice and resources that I could access anytime, anywhere.  \nThis digital lifeline was a game-changer for me. Slowly, I began to find my footing again. I learned mindfulness techniques to manage my anxiety, found online study groups that helped alleviate the loneliness, and engaged in virtual counseling sessions that offered the support I so desperately needed.  \nMy journey through the maze of mental health and academia taught me valuable lessons, not just about resilience and self-care, but about the importance of accessible support for students. It's a cause I've now dedicated myself to, advocating for better mental health resources on campus and raising awareness about the digital tools that can make a difference.  \nI share my story not for sympathy, but to shed light on an issue that affects countless students. It's a call to action for universities to prioritize mental health as much as academic achievement. It's also a message of hope to those who are struggling in silence\u2014you are not alone, and there is help available.  \nAs I continue my journey, both as a student and an advocate for mental health, I am reminded of the power of sharing our stories. It's through these narratives that we can break down the stigma, build understanding, and foster a community where no one has to navigate their darkest moments alone.  \nTo anyone reading this who sees themselves in my story, know that your feelings are valid, your experiences are real, and there is a path to healing. Together, we can create a change, making mental health support not just an option but a fundamental part of the student experience.  \nIn sharing my story, I hope to inspire others to speak out, seek help, and support one another. Let's make mental health a priority, not just during exams, but throughout our entire educational journey.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I\u2019ve lost 10 pounds in a month (I\u2019ve been the same weight since freshman year of high school), got diagnosed with central sleep apnea, which is just fantastic cause now I have another thing to be anxious about and there\u2019s no way to help me being exhausted all the time rn, I think I have insomnia which doesn\u2019t help at all, and now I\u2019m about 2 months behind in school. \nI can\u2019t just graduate anyways, I have to make up those hours so now I\u2019m stuck here longer and dealing with everything. My class days are 9am-5:30pm every single day and I\u2019m suffering. I\u2019ve already taken a few weeks health break & being behind is making me anxious to go to class which is making me miss more and then the cycle repeats, & my grad date gets pushed farther back. \nI\u2019ve talked with my school in depth and shown doctor notes and gotten only minimal accommodations, I don\u2019t want to drop out but I\u2019m at an all time low in my physical and mental health. I just don\u2019t know what to do. Everything feels pointless bc I always get kicked back down once I\u2019ve gained some hope for my life and happiness. On top of it, I moved to a new city for this school and have no friends and know no one but my sister, I\u2019m an introvert but my mental health is getting in the way of even wanting to go out or attempt to meet people so even though I\u2019m content by myself, I\u2019m getting so lonely and becoming a miserable vegetable. \nI thought I had a rough freshman year of college, but this is 100x worse and I\u2019m drowning. I hate everyday, and I\u2019m just so so\u2026 sad. I can\u2019t stand it. \nSo yea that\u2019s it, sorry if u made it this far, I just needed to tell someone because no one in my family or friends can understand what I\u2019m going through. \n(Also if u read this & think u know who this is, no u don\u2019t, ignore this please lmao)","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

(Me two boys and him 2 girls) The youngest being 10 at the time. I waso verwhelmed by the idea of starting over. \n\nOver the next few weeks I had complications and after several doctor\u2019s appointments and screenings I was told that I miscarried.\n\n I had terrible hemorrhaging that hid her heartbeat from view. At my last appointment they sent me to am the hospital for an ultrasound to decide if I needed a DNC. The tech found a heartbeat. I hadn\u2019t miscarried  but they were not confident that it was a viable pregnancy. Nobody knew but me and my husband. \n\nApril- my boy\u2019s biological father was murdered by his wife\u2019s affair. Shot in the back of the head when he came home from work early. \nWe had just closed on a house and were in the middle of moving when this happened. My boys spent 12 weeks going to therapy. It was a difficult difficult time. \n\nWe spent the summer going to therapy, drs appointments, and renovating the house. We had to wait nearly 4 months along to tell them about the baby because I couldn\u2019t bear to let them lose someone else. \n\nI am a muralist and painted 9 of them in 2023. My biggest I had waited months to start because of payment delays with the city. \n\nThe house we bought was a  flipper. We started showing in October. Balancing the turmoil, pregnancy, and real estate doing the holidays was very hard. We had family staying with us for several weeks during that time.  \n\nWe barely made it through Thanksgiving and I finally, at 8 months pregnant, was able to start the final and largest mural. I desperately needed to because we were having financial issues with everything going on. I painted for 2 days and went into early labor. \n\nMy daughter was born at 36 weeks via emergency C-section; thankfully very healthy. \n\nNewborn life and Christmas. Everyone I worked with had pretty much ghosted me when I was unable to fulfill their needs during this time. Life went silent. \n\nI\u2019m now 3 months postpartum and haven\u2019t been able to get back to the mural and it\u2019s bothering me so much that it sits unfinished. I homeschool everyone and my husband works full time. \n\nThe kiddos are ask doing amazingly well \u2026 I just feel so overwhelmed, burnt out, and alone. I have maybe two friends other than my husband but we haven\u2019t been close in years so I don\u2019t feel like I can talk to them about this.\n\n I know this isn\u2019t eloquently written\u2026 I just needed to vent.

I'm sorry I don't have much advice but try to work on each of your problems one by one. \n\nI know you've been trying to do this already from what you said but for the complaining thing, remember to practice gratitude. Yes we can become ungrateful at times and that's normal, you're not alone. But try to be thankful for what you already have and think about how it could be worse. For every negative thought try to think of at least one positive one. We're naturally pessimistic so I guess we need to consciously remind ourselves to also focus on the positives. \n\nAnd for the anxiety... I'm not sure how to combat it, sorry. I think you might have to observe your thinking patterns to see what's wrong and what's causing it exactly. For me personally I tend to avoid problems instead of facing them and have unrealistic expectations which is part of the cause of my anxiety among a few other things. Once you work out whats causing it it becomes much easier\n\n\nOooh. I forgot to add it here. But (not shaming you, its okay, I'm not saying you're a bad person please don't take it personally I just want to help) a lot of the times with anxiety and depression and other metal illnesses it comes down to a few things \n- already mentioned this but not being grateful enough and having unrealistically high expectations\n- being self centered. I say self centered rather than selfish because selfish has a more negative connotation and implies harm to other people. Whereas self centered is more neutral (so its like if you're selfish your self centered but if your self centered you're not necessarily selfish). We're always focusing on our own needs and wants and our own feelings and how our life is (which is important no doubt, you should value your needs as well) but there needs to be balance. Try to focus on other people as well. Be happy for them. It can really help","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

Really, anything at this point. I will even take insults. I am feeling like a complete and total failure at everything in life and irredeemably worthless.\n\nIf you look at me on the outside, you will see someone who seems to have everything together. I am privileged to have a decent full-time remote job with decent benefits, a house, a spouse, and a kid who is doing well in school. But it is all a facade. An illusion. On the inside, I am a complete wreck and have been for a long time. I have 0 friends, literally 0. I am not close to anyone in my family and have no real support system other than myself. And I have had a series of events unfold in the last couple of months that have put me over the edge.\n\n1) My spouse announced that she was unhappy in the marriage and has been for years and wants to separate and possibly divorce. She does not want to try any counseling. We have had some struggles over the past few years, but this shocked me to the core. I had no idea that she was so unhappy with me and had been for so long. It seems that I was completely oblivious to an entire layer and series of indirect communication about her unhappiness.\n\n2) Up until now, my work has largely been tasks that I could do on my own with minimal social interaction beyond email, messaging, or the occasional off-camera virtual meeting. I had a routine that I followed every day. This worked very well for me, as I have always struggled with social interaction and chaotic work environments. Now, my job is evolving to require more on-camera virtual meetings that I will need to lead, more on-camera coordination and interaction with larger groups of people, more randomly scheduled sporadic (and pointless) virtual meetings, and fewer of the independent tasks that I prefer and enjoy doing.\n\n3) Even though many of my colleagues scattered around the country (US) have worked successfully in full-time remote positions for years, my employer has joined the \"Return to Office\" bandwagon to improve \"collaboration\" and \"culture\" and is mandating that all employees come into the nearest office soon. Two-hour commute for me each way to a building in a notoriously bad and dangerous area with an open floorplan, exceedingly bright lights, and very poor noise abatement. All to \"collaborate\" with my colleagues (none in my location) via Zoom\/Teams.\n\n4) My whole life, I have had an intense interest in numbers. As a kid, I used to spend hours at the library poring over population statistics, sports statistics, any statistics I could get my hands on. Numbers make sense to me. They are unambiguous. They have clear rules. There are no hidden meanings or \"reading between the lines\" or emotional component. They do not require social interaction. The number is the number. \n\nI have also had an intense interest in technology, particularly computers. I remember spending hours on Usenet and using NCSA Mosaic (showing my age here) to explore the Internet. In high school and college, my free time was spent in computer labs. As I got older, I started to collect older computers and loved to spend time tinkering and repairing them and creating elaborate spreadsheets detailing all the technical specifications. And that became my passion and my escape and the one place where I could experience some degree of joy. I started buying older computers to work on. I had it in my head that I would eventually repair and resell some of them and hold on to some of the more vintage ones for a longer term and resell them for a profit. And then I bought more. And more. And I would dutifully record the technical specifications in my spreadsheet. And then rinse and repeat. It reached the point where I had the large part of a room filled with computers. They were all neatly organized and cataloged. But there were a lot. As I look it at now objectively, I realize that I went overboard and that I spent far too much money on it. \n\nThe thing is is that I never really noticed the spending on computers. As the numbers guy, I have been the one to handle all the finances in our household since the beginning. But I did not track our spending at that level of detail. Every month, we were maxing out our retirement savings, paying our mortgage (including an extra principal payment to pay it off faster), paying all our bills, paying our credit card balances in full, and not incurring any new debt. We had money for travel and for emergencies. Our net worth kept increasing year to year. It looked like we were doing fine. But without the spending on computers, we would have been saving a lot more. \nI have been going through the transactions over the last few years and am recording all the spending on computers, and it has made me sick to my stomach. I do not have a final amount, but it will be a lot. And I feel like a complete idiot and total failure for all the spending that I did. And I know that once I have a final figure and share it with my spouse, she will likely be livid and the already remote chance of salvaging our seemingly doomed marriage will be obliterated.\n\nSo as I write this, I am feeling completely despondent, humiliated, and am in a really dark place. I have failed everyone and can't see anything to look forward to. I have even had fleeting thoughts of travelling all the way out to San Francisco to pay a visit to the Golden Gate Bridge, but now that they have implemented 2-Step verification (deterrent net), that option is less viable. Sorry, a feeble attempt at some gallows humor. I am safe.\n\nSorry that this is so long. Thank you for reading this, and I welcome anything anyone can offer. I could really use it right now. Thank you.","Score":1,"Total_comments":1}

There is a lot of childhood trauma (diagnosed as C-PTSD), I'm autistic and have been going through periods of depression since my early teens. I probably have undiagnosed ADHD but with the waiting lists where I live at, that's going to be undiagnosed for a long time.\n\nI struggle with: Having no friends, no romantic relationships, no positive relationships with my family, my flat being messy, feeling worthless, poor physical health, looking average on my best days, little success at work, going back to uni at 23 and not finishing my degree before the age of 27 (if I even manage to finish it), living from paycheck to paycheck. There isn't much going well for me but there are some things: I have an affordable flat, I am somehow employable and able to work at least part-time, I am unable to deal with \"normal\" social situations but do have strategies to manage the usual workplace interactions.\n\nThe main issue I have is: I've never experienced anything different. I don't know what living without depression and other mental health issues feels like. For me personally, I don't feel like I'm living \\*with\\* a mental health problem. The mental health problem feels like a part of me, like a personality trait or something. But I don't want to - I can't - spend another 60 or something years like this.  \nThe last two years, I actively looked for professional help, so far with little success. I can't afford therapy for more than two sessions a month and all of the anti-depressants I've tried (now five in total) have either made my depression worse or they had severe side effects. I'm open to trying new medications and strategies but there is little specialised psychiatric care for neurodivergent people especially when I can't afford private care. So maybe this won't be a hit.\n\nI'm since a few months at a place in my life where I feel completely hopeless and as if there is no chance for me to live a fulfilling life. I see two options now: Kill myself or somehow find a way to heal\/find meaning\/reduce pain. I'm not expecting to become a happy person or some kind of a high achiever.

Can I get better?","Author":"salemlambda","Timestamp":1709235637000,"Text":"I'm sorry that you've been struggling your entire life.  It sounds like your life has been difficult and unfair.\n\nYou sound smart and capable to me.  There's certainly nothing wrong with graduating at 27, as most people never graduate to begin with.  Most people live paycheck to paycheck, because life is pretty harsh and difficult unless you were born into privilege, so don't feel bad about any of that.  I do understand how hard and limiting that is, though.  To me, it sounds like you've accomplished a lot, despite having a lot of mental health struggles.\n\nI think your main focus right now should definitely be your mental health.  That's unfortunate that the wait times to see someone are so long where you live.  Are there any online options available that might be cheaper and faster?  \n\nI understand struggling with social interactions.  I \"mask\" almost all of my interactions as well, doing whatever I have to do to appear normal.  It's exhausting.  That's good that you have strategies for it.  Is there a reason that you don't have friends and family in your life?  Do you purposely avoid it because it's too difficult?  Maybe it would be a good idea trying to be more social, even if it's on your terms with what you're comfortable with.  It can be hard to make friends, and it gets harder as you get older, because you don't have peers your age constantly around you like when you're in school.  I spent pretty much all of my life in a self-imposed isolation, and I can tell you that it's not worth it.  In the end, we're social creatures and it's pretty essential to our well-being to have others around us.\n\nYou are definitely not worthless.  Your worth is intrinsic and immeasurable.  I don't think your situation is hopeless at all, I think you should keep trying.  You mentioned finding meaning, do you mean like your life's purpose?  If so, I think it's worth leaning into that idea.  Think about what means the most to you, and find a way to infuse that more into your life.  Life will be empty if it's just work, mindless entertainment, and sleep.  I very much hope that you never hurt yourself, that would be very sad.  I think you would be better off taking that out as an option, realizing that the only choice is to move forward and making your life better can help.  I hope things get better for you soon.  Don't give up.","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

Anger is a a gateway emotion - it's the emotion of action.

Every emotion means something, and carries it's own kind of energy, and that energy doesn't disappear, it must go somewhere.

I had alot of unresolved issues from my teens and adulthood plus with my mum dying 5 years ago I fell into a deep depression and anxiety that I just buried. decided to get some help cause I was fed up feeling like crap 24\/7. did some CBT therapy but I never found it helpful if anything it made me feel worse. came off my ssri before Christmas after titrating down cause it muted everything and if anything I was getting more depressed. drs didn't know I was getting more depressed but I didn't feel the meds I was taking were the answer after taking them for so long. anyways after coming off them I felt great up until about 2 weeks ago. bam I wake up one morning and something switched in my head and I now feel hopeless and lost and feel like I'm in a massive hole I can't get out of, haven't slept in about 3\/4 days and sleep in general has been poor when I do sleep. nothing has happened to me personally since coming off the ssri to make me feel this way so I don't understand why I'm feeling like this. it's a feeling I can't shake no matter what I'm trying to do.

I have not felt depressed for the first time in my life last year when I moved countries and met my boyfriend. Not my first but the first and only I really cared about (I'm almost 30). Everything with him felt new and exciting so I guess the hormones associated with what people call love (which I didn't believe in) made me happy for the first time in my life. It's not like I was stupid enough to think that my depression was magically cured, but deep down I wished for it. At the same time I dreaded it coming back full force every day and that's what happened last week. I tried to deal with it on my own like I always did, the sleepness nights, the existential dread and panic attacks at night and the compulsive thoughts to jump from every bridge and in front of every car. But yesterday, on his birthday, I couldn't contain it. I suddenly got scared looking at him. Of the inavoidable future and the burden I would be on him. And I showed it by being an asshole and at the end of our fight just running home where I sent him an accusatory message about breaking up. I hate myself, I ruined not only his birthday but also the celebration of him finding a new job. He was my last chance. That's what I told myself at the beginnend of our relationship. I can't do this anymore and I can't do this to anymore anymore. I feel incredibly manipulative for basically forcing him to have a talk this weekend by just appearing at his doorstep in teams. But at the same time I break down every time I think about him not being in my life. But it is not fair of me to make him stay in a relationship with me. It's just so hard. Nobody, not even my family, has ever even liked me and I don't care for anyone but him. If I lose him, I don't think I can recover from it. For the first time I had something to look forward to but I ruined it by questioning his feelings for me and projecting that fear on him. Now I'm lying here wondering how I'm supposed to endure this pain. It's even worse than before meeting him or at least it feels like it because I haven't felt it in a while.

It was a pretty early start and I\u2019ve gained recognition for my fast progress. I\u2019ve been to some contests and got awards, and tried to pass levels. Even though I never took piano seriously, and only practiced an average of 30-40 minutes a day, I was still learning something new everyday. It was still something I was good at, something I was partially proud of. Later after I was introduced to RCM, I started taking a different path, some of my progress before was lost, and I realized there is so much areas I needed improving on. I went to lessons regularly, although progress wasn\u2019t as fast, I was still practicing regularly and I was able to play pieces I liked. When I was around 11. I passed my RCM level 8 practical and theory exam. Preparing for the exams had been most efficient in improving my skills. Later I was learning level 9, and I had switched my teacher. This new teacher made me nervous for every lesson, and I was dreading it every two days before class. However my skills were improving greatly so I guess there is nothing to complain about. But things escalated and I started getting anxiety before every class and it made my stomach sick. It was then I decided to switch back to my old teacher and continue on with where I left off. My progress slowed once again and I didn\u2019t do any exams at the time. When I was 12 I started level 9 history, and I was one hell of a procrastinator. I spent a whole year but only studied effectively in the last month before the deadline, even though I got a pretty good mark, it definitely took too long to complete, and I was not proud at all. That was what made me realize how much faster others have finished theirs and moving on, while I wasted a whole year? Soon after I started harmony 9, I know I shouldn\u2019t even be complaining because how easy it was for the people that studied along with me. Yes, I joined an online group taught by a different teacher. That was the absolute worst part about learning music. When everyone else seems to get everything while your own brain is completely fried. When the teacher finished most of the lessons she said I needed extra help. Which just makes me feel like an outcast. I was in the middle of doing those catch-up lessons when I, out of nothing in this world, told my parents I didn\u2019t want to continue learning piano anymore. And if you have read to the very end I want to thank you for taking the time to do so, and I want to share the fact that, things went downhill so quick after I decided to give up. I never finished harmony 9, and it makes me feel like a failure. I did started to play level 10 before, but never took the exam. Now I\u2019m 14 and I feel like I was worse than I was 2 years ago, because I\u2019m cowardly enough, that I can\u2019t even look at a piano anymore. So I never proved myself to be worthy of having lessons again. And every night I just think about the fact that I wasted so much time and money, but all I did was give up? I tried and tried to play my favourite pieces, but I would get so frustrated because of my declining skills and feel absolutely worthless. I feel like everyone else is moving on, passing exams after exams, while I keep retreating, back to the place where I started.","Score":3,"Total_comments":1}

Right after that, well, it only got worse. The first time I got my hands on a vape was when I stole it from my friend's mom (who later found out).\nAnd we and Mo burned that shit out in two days flat. Remember, I was in 5th grade. We looked through his dad's part of the house and found a lighter and a box of cigarettes. We smoked them, laughed, and rapped some songs I came up with. Man, I was a dumbass kid. We smoked every day on anything we could get ahold of, and Mo even got a girl friend.

Way too many to count. I\u2019ve said and done a lot of bad things and made many mistakes.. however.. the thing that gets to me the most is all of the lies I have told. I am a recovering compulsive\/psychological liar. I lied about so many things.. big or small. There were so many little things that I have lied about for absolutely no reason. Just the smallest, stupidest things. Things that I had absolutely no reason to lie about and things that do not even matter. I just lied all the time for no reason. I\u2019ve even gone as far as making up the most rediculous stories that were total lies and didn\u2019t actually happen. I don\u2019t know what I did it. I really don\u2019t. All the lies I\u2019ve told.. some being big.. some being small.. some being tiny & pointless.. I don\u2019t know why I did it. I really don\u2019t. It eats me alive inside. I am a different person now and I am an honest person. I have worked on myself and made myself better. But I dwell on my past 24\/7 and even being a better person now.. I cannot enjoy myself or my life whatsoever because I am so ashamed, embarrassed, and humiliated of my past and my past mistakes. I just want to forgive myself and move on. I don\u2019t know why I did it.. and I think maybe I will never know.. but right now.. all I want is to forgive myself and enjoy my life and not dwell on my past 24\/7 to the point where it\u2019s making me physically ill.

At the start of these last 4 years I stopped taking them since my life started to become the best it had ever been. Until it slowly became so much worse all over again. I was being medicated for adhd most of those 4 years. Now I stopped taking everything.\n\nI haven't even been drinking alcohol anymore, I thought the only way out of this was clarity.  \nThat I needed to be completely clear in my mind. I try so hard to go to sleep early, wake up early, have consistency in my life and get my head back above the surface, but now I just lie awake all night in bed, thinking of all the things I could have done better. Every night I think about my ex. I cant help it. I'm never really asleep. Thoughts of her drift into dreams and back into conscious thoughts but im always half awake. \n\nI wake up crying, sometimes happy tears, but they always end sadly when I realize she isn't there. I've tried sleeping on her side of the bed, and even on the couch so that my brain doesn't trick itself into thinking that things are like they used to be. \n\nI'm working out, eating healthy, trying to do everything I've learnt from therapy over the years, but it's not working. I use my inhaler more often than I smoke cigarettes now and I can still barely breathe. \n\nI know I dug myself into a corner this time. Debt's are catching up to me, everyone in my family is going through there own hardships too.  \nThroughout my life, ever since my first depressive episodes, every time I'd overcome them, I grew stronger, or so I told myself. I'd become better equipped to deal with those hardships. \n\nNo matter how much better I got at dealing with it, even at the best of times, there was always a persistent uneasy feeling like a dark draping entity was working in the background, learning how to sabotage my progress, learning how hide seeds of chaos throughout my life so they should all flourish in crushing unison to bury me under myself when my weakest point had finally been reached.\n\nI'm suffocating under the debris of that destruction now and I'm not strong enough to dig myself out whole this time. It's warm under here surrounded by the memories of her love, but even those memories have thorns.\n\nI've been bleeding out for too long. I cant wake up anymore. \n\nI know it's the end now.

The summer after I graduated high school, I was very happy. I had a lot of friends, I went outside, I ran and lifted weights, etc. \n\nI knew this was gonna end, however. I had to move, and everyone\u2019s off to college now. I was still around (kinda), but I didn\u2019t have my own car at the time, so I didn\u2019t really have the freedom of going wherever I wanted. Eventually, I\u2019m not hanging out with people as much, and not making any new friends. It was my first winter break where it hit me: I realized, \u201cwait, I don\u2019t actually think I\u2019m truly enjoying anything\u201d\n\nFast forward to my sophomore year of college. I had no clue what I wanted to major in, skipped classes all the time, no friends, no consistent habits, etc. I\u2019d have phases of going to the gym regularly, eating well, even looking better and more in-shape, but I never ended up keeping up those habits. Because I never ended up CARING. About ANYTHING.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the present: To run things down, I\u2019m unfortunately smart enough where most of the time, I don\u2019t try in my classes, but I get away with passing them. I have made zero friends in the past 3 years, I am not much bigger or stronger than I was that summer after high school, and I still don\u2019t care about anything (obviously).\n\nThis semester, I actually have gotten better with keeping up with homework and such. Except for one class. I have a midterm tomorrow (well technically today), and I have had ALL DAY to prepare for it. But I end up doing NOTHING. I have shot myself in the fucking foot. Do I care? Do I not care? Am I fucking bipolar? WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?????? I\u2019m gonna lose my mind. One day everything\u2019s fine and the next I self destruct and potentially set myself up for failing a class.\n\nI definitely need help holy shit","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}
